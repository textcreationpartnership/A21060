            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is an high opinion that men generally have of the Sacrament, and reaſon good, it

That which was once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the Dominican Prieſts, in memory <note place="margin">Morn. myſt.

It matters not before God with what hand the Sacrament be received, the <hi>right-hand</hi> or the <hi>left,</hi> ſo the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>right,</hi> and the work done in a <hi>right order.</hi> But yet in a ſpirituall ſenſe to be left-handed recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is a matter, not only of <hi>diſgrace,</hi> but of <hi>danger.</hi> It is all one in Scripture phraſe, to be <hi>left,</hi> and to be <hi>lame-handed.</hi> And to be ſure, to be left-handed in this worke, is to be lame-handed. The lame, and the blinde, who knowes not in what ill eſteeme they were with God? The lame and the blind had no acceptance with God. And wherein concernes it men to be more ſolicitous for acceptance, than in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb facs="tcp:260:3"/> ſervice of receiving the Sacrament? No acceptance is to be had, but when it is well done. <hi>If thou do well, ſhalt thou not be accepted,</hi> ſayes the Lord to <hi>Cain?</hi> It was <hi>good</hi> which <hi>Cain</hi> did in offering Sacrifice; but if thou do <hi>well,</hi> ſhalt thou not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? It muſt be a <hi>good</hi> thing, and a <hi>good</hi> thing <hi>well</hi> done, which ſhal find acceptance.

They were croſſes and afflictions which (by Gods providence) befell <hi>Aaron</hi> in the death of his Sons, and the ſorrow and mourning that followed thereupon, that indiſpoſed and unfitted him for eating the fleſh of the ſin-offering. <hi>Sanctified things were not to be eaten in a mans mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

And for want of this and other due diſpoſitions, it is, that this holy Ordinance that men ſeeme to think ſo highly and reverently of, is ſo much abuſed and profaned.</p>

That which is thine owne, is ſo much the more deere, by how much the more rare. Who ſhall finde a vertuous woman, much more a vertuous and Noble one? God indeed is no accepter of perſons, yet I know not how it comes to paſſe, yet to paſſe it comes, that vertue in a Noble perſon is more pleaſing, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it is more ſhining.</hi> As light is more glorious in the Stars of greater, than of leſſer magnitude.

<pb facs="tcp:260:5"/> ever more and more Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi>; and long may Your Houſe flouriſh, in ſuch and all other Honor. Experience lets us ſee, that not only Nobles, but Nobility it ſelfe is mortall; and that not only Great Men, but Great Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes dye. Yet there is a way to make Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Houſes longer lived than many times they be. <hi>Davids</hi> prayer was this, <hi>Let</hi>

Then doe Great Ones bleſſe their Houſes, when among other things they be like the Nobles of Iſrael. Thoſe Nobles had their ſtaves, which haply they bare in their hands as Enſignes of their Nobility. Now they made thoſe ſtaves which were the Enſignes of their Honour, the inſtruments alſo of common good: <hi>The Princes digged the well, the Nobles of the people digged it with</hi>

               <hi>their ſtaves.</hi> With their ſtaves of Honour they digged a Well for the common good, and publike benefit of the people. That is one ſpeciall way to keep the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> long in a Family; and long to continue the Honour, Nobility, Dignity, and wealth of great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; when they improve their Honours and Power, to honour God, in being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable what they can to publike good. It lies a black blot upon the Nobles of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> that they <hi>put not their necks to the work of</hi>

That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims,</hi> they ſend for the Arke of <hi>God</hi> from <hi>Shiloh</hi> to bee brought into the Campe, that it might ſave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:260:10"/> them out of the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Such be the ſilly and the poore confidences of carnall and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts, to reſt and rely more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward ſignes of <hi>Gods</hi> preſence, and to betruſt their ſafety with them, than to take care for the preſence of <hi>God</hi> Himſelfe. As if <hi>God</hi> had beene ſo chained to his Arke, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>God</hi> himſelfe muſt needs come into their Campe. A far wiſer courſe it had beene, to have taken a courſe to have fetcht the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> himſelfe, then the Arke of the Covenant of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi> GOD could, and would have holpen them without the Arke; but alas, What could the Ark doe without <hi>God?</hi> They might have learned another thing from <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 10. 36. <hi>And it came to paſſe when the Arke ſet forward, that</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, Riſe up O Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered.</hi> He knew, and taught, That though the Arke did riſe, yet if God ſate ſtill, it would not make one ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my flie; but let <hi>God</hi> ariſe, and <hi>let his</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:260:10"/> 
                  <hi>enemies bee ſcattered:</hi> it is <hi>Gods riſing</hi> that is the enemies <hi>ſcattering.</hi> And ſuppoſe there had beene ſomewhat in the outward preſence of the Arke, yet what hope of helpe could they have by it, as it came attended? <hi>And the two Sons of Ely,</hi> ſayes the Text, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas, were there with the Arke of the Covenant of God.</hi> Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle likelyhood of <hi>Gods</hi> being there, when they were there. Their preſence in the Campe was likelier to do them more miſchiefe, than the Arkes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was like to doe them good. But they ſo dote upon the Arke, and put ſuch confidence in it, have it they muſt, and have it they will, not taking care to bring <hi>God</hi> along with it, nor being in any feare of miſcarriage, though it comes upon the prophane ſhoulders of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas.</hi> Well, and when they have it, how ſpeed they? That confidence of theirs was miſerably checkt, not onely by their owne ruine and overthrow, but by the captivity of the Arke. Even
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:260:11"/> that which they hoped ſhould have ſaved them out of the hand of their enemies, was delivered into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, <hi>He delivered his ſtrength into captivity, and his glory into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand, Pſal.</hi> 78. 61. So righteous it is with <hi>God,</hi> to let men ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their fond confidences, <hi>That the winde ſhall carry them all away, that vanity ſhall take them, Iſa.</hi> 57. 13. <hi>That he rejects ſuch confidences, and that men ſhall not proſper in them, Ier.</hi> 2. 37. Well, but now though Iſraels confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences be in the duſt; yet have the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> little reaſon to vaunt of their victory: The Arke, though it ſaves not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet proves a plague to the <hi>Philiſtims: God</hi> ſoone makes them weary of their booty, and make them glad to returne it home againe, and that with flying colours, and in an honourable manner. And now the Arke returning, is not ſeated as before at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where it had beene till its captivity, ever ſince the dayes of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> but was placed in the Citie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:260:11"/> of <hi>Kiriath-Iearim,</hi> a Citie in <hi>Iudah.</hi> There it remained ſeparated from the Tabernacle, unto the time of <hi>Davids</hi> ferching it thence, which could not be leſſe than about the ſpace of forty ſeven yeeres. <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the people forty yeeres, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> raigned in <hi>Hebron</hi> ſeven yeares before he came to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> All this while were the Arke and Tabernacle ſeparated: yea, the Ark was not inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, <hi>all the dayes of Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. 3. Out of all which by the way we may note; That the want of ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of GOD doth not annull a Church of <hi>God.</hi> A Church may want ſome Ordinances, Ordinances of great weight, &amp; yet be a true Church; or elſe for theſe forty ſeven yeeres there had beene no true Church, nor true worſhip in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo not in the world. The Arke, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at it, was a matter of great weight in <hi>Gods</hi> Church, and worſhip. It was one of the moſt ſpeciall types of Chriſt, a ſymball of <hi>Gods</hi> gracious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:260:12"/> and ſpeciall preſence: it was the place of <hi>Gods</hi> ſpeciall reſidence; hee dwelt betweene the Cherubims, and from thence hee gave anſwers. It was the firſt and chiefeſt of al the holy things, for it principally, was the Tabernacle made, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 18. 21. It ſanctified the whole Tabernacle, <hi>The places are holy whereinto the Arke of the</hi> Lord <hi>hath come,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 8. 11. And yet this Arke out of the Tabernacle, the place of worſhip and ſacrifice, the ſpace of forty ſeven yeares. Yea more, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all <hi>Davids</hi> time it continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Tabernacle, it being pitched in a Tent by it ſelfe at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the Tabernacle being at the High-place in <hi>Cibeon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 13. The Arke and the Tabernacle never came together more, after it was once removed from <hi>Shiloh;</hi> but when <hi>Salomon</hi> built the Temple, and the Tabernacle was diſſolved, then was the Arke placed in the Holy of Holies in the Temple. And yet all this while who will ſay they had not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:260:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> true worſhip, and a true Church? wants therefore, and defects in a Church, unchurch it not.</p>
               <p>The Arke now having continued forty ſeven yeeres at <hi>Kiriath-Iearim, David</hi> being made King over all <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and come to <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> the firſt thing we reade he did, after his plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſeſſion of, and Inauguration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome, is to bring home the Arke from <hi>Kiriath-Iearim</hi> unto <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> In the bringing it home they meet with a ſhrewd check, and a ſore miſcarriage in the death of <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah;</hi> and that by reaſon of a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the carriage of the Arke upon a Cart, which ſhould have been born upon the Prieſts ſhoulders. <hi>David</hi> finding their former errour, and their faile in a preſcribed formality, doth now a ſecond time ſet upon the work, and in this Chapter and place, direct the Prieſts what courſe to take, and gives them to underſtand, that for want of this obſervance, <hi>God</hi> gave them that former blow in <hi>Vzzahs</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:260:13"/> death. <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves both ye and your brethren, that you may bring up the Arke of the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> namely upon your owne ſhoulders, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 14. as the fifteenth Verſe of this Chapter explaines it. <hi>For becauſe ye did it not at firſt, V.</hi> 13. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>our</hi> God <hi>made a breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, It was not onely <hi>Vzzahs</hi> errour in touching the Ark contrary to that, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 15. but it was all your errors to carry it in a Cart, when it ſhould have beene borne upon your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Indeed unto the Sons of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhon,</hi> and to the Sons of <hi>Merari Moſes</hi> gave Wagons and Oxen, according to their ſervice, but unto the Sons of <hi>Kohatb</hi> (who were to beare the Ark, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 5, 15.) he gave none, <hi>Becauſe the ſervice of the Sanctuary belonging to them, was, that they ſhould be are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſhoulders, Num.</hi> 7. 6, 7, 8, 9. A <hi>Gerſhonites</hi> or a <hi>Merarites</hi> burthen might be carted, but not a <hi>Kohatbites,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:260:13"/> they muſt put their ſhoulders to the burthen. And for this irregularity was the breach made. Indeed the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſent home the Ark in a Cart, but God brookes not the carting of the Arke in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> God will beare with that in Heathens and Strangers, which he will not brooke, nor winck at in his owne people, who muſt live by rule. Hee will be ſanctified in all thoſe that draw neere unto him. So preciſely ſtrict is God for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Ordinances; and ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſo quick a Iudge in caſes of the ſmalleſt prevarication.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth Verſe then is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that counſell given, <hi>V.</hi> 12. You muſt ſanctifie your ſelves, and you muſt bring home the Ark. We went another way to worke before; and Gods diſpleaſure brake out againſt us, becauſe we ſought him not after the due order. The Point then wee may learne, is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is not enough to ſeeke</hi> God, <hi>but we muſt ſeeke him after the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:260:14"/> 
                  <hi>that he hath appointed, and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:</hi> And, <hi>That where</hi> God <hi>is not ſought after the due order, there men not onely meet not with a bleſsing, but with a blow, and with a breach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To goe and fetch the Arke, and to enquire of God at it, it was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but to neglect the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of themſelves, that they might bring up the Arke of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to carry it in a Cart, this was not according to Gods <hi>Order.</hi> His order was that they themſelves ſhould beare it, and that they ſhould ſanctifie themſelves before-hand for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>David</hi> and his people made full account of it, when they went about that dayes worke, to have had a good and a comfortable day of it: but <hi>Gods</hi> order being neglected, inſtead of a bleſſing, they meet with a blow, and a breach. It proved a ſad day, they were ſent home with ſad and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts. It is true indeed, that the carrying of the Arke upon a Cart, was a faile but in point of outward
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:260:14"/> order, the due outward order was not obſerved. And if <hi>God</hi> be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in making a breach upon them, for the breach of an outward order, How much more ſevere may it bee thought will he be in denying a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and in making a breach for the neglect and breach of that ſpirituall and inward order, with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires holy ſervices to be performed. God hath preſcribed not onely holy <hi>Ordinances</hi> and wayes, in which he will be ſought and found; but he hath alſo preſcribed an holy <hi>Order,</hi> and a ſpirituall manner, after which, and in which, he will be ſought in the uſe of thoſe his Ordinances. Gods <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and Gods <hi>Order</hi> muſt ever goe together. Let us ſuppoſe that which cannot be. Suppoſe that a man could ſeeke <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>right Order,</hi> in regard of inward diſpoſition of ſpirit, in a <hi>wrong Ordinance;</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> being ſought in a <hi>wrong Ordinance</hi> though in a right <hi>Order,</hi> no bleſſing, but a breach were to be expected. So contrarily,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:260:15"/> Though a man ſeek <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>right Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> yet if he ſeeke him in a <hi>wrong Order,</hi> for inward frame of heart, not a bleſſing, but a breach would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. As no bleſſing to be expected from a right Order in a wrong Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo no bleſſing from a right Ordinance in a wrong Order. The bleſſing is derived from <hi>God,</hi> through a right Ordinance uſed after a due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We ſhall ſee both going there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore together. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyces, and workes righteouſneſſe, thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes.</hi> Here is firſt, <hi>Gods</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, communion, and fellowſhip with <hi>God, Thou meeteſt him.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> meets a man ſeeking him, there is a bleſſing: but marke in the next place how the bleſſing is met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And that by doing two things. Firſt there is a ſeeking in <hi>Gods</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>That remember thee in thy wayes.</hi> They that will meet GOD muſt ſeeke him in his <hi>owne wayes.</hi> His Ordinances are his <hi>wayes,</hi> and his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:260:15"/> 
                  <hi>walkes.</hi> If wee make walkes, and wayes of our owne, there can bee no meeting of GOD in them, becauſe Hee will walke in no wayes but His owne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>ſeeking</hi> in <hi>Gods Order, that rejoyces, that workes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> There muſt bee a ſeeking Him in that Spirituall manner, with the heart ſet in due order, in all thoſe gracious diſpoſitions that GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and then GOD meetes a man. But now as a man that ſeekes GOD out of His Ordinance meetes not with Him, becauſe he ſeekes Him not in His wayes, ſo though a man doe ſeeke Him in His wayes, yet if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not, and worke not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but ſeekes God with an unholy, a dead, and a dull heart, though he bee in Gods wayes, and ſeeke God in a right Ordinance, yet he ſeekes not in a right order, and therefore neither GOD nor His bleſſing met withall. GOD meetes with a man that ſeekes him in both joyntly, <hi>Right Ordinance,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:260:16"/> and <hi>right order.</hi> The like we have, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 12, 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me, &amp; ye ſhall goe, and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye ſhall ſeeke me, &amp; find me, when you ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi> Here is a promiſe of a bleſſing to them that ſeeke God. But firſt they muſt ſeeke God in His Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. <hi>Yee ſhall call upon mee, and yee ſhall go, and pray unto mee;</hi> not goe to Saints, Angels, Images, Idols, that's none of Gods Ordinance. Secondly, they muſt ſeeke God after His Order, <hi>when yee ſhall ſearch for mee with all your heart.</hi> Thus Gods bleſſing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſeeking in His Ordinance, and Order joyntly. If they prayed with all their heart, that were His Order, but if they prayed to an Image, that were not His ordinance, therefore in ſuch a caſe would he not be found. So againe, if they prayed to Him, that were His Ordinance, but if they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dead, and dull hearts, that were not His Order, therefore neither in ſuch a caſe would He be found.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:260:16"/>
               <p> But this is not all. There is not only no <hi>bleſsing,</hi> but there is a <hi>breach</hi> where <hi>God</hi> is not ſought after the <hi>Due Order.</hi> Wee ſhall ſee it true in the ſeverall Ordinances wherin God is ſought.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the <hi>Word.</hi> God is ſought in the Miniſtery of the Word, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Before time in Iſrael, when a man went to enquire of</hi> GOD, <hi>thus he ſpake: Come let us goe to the Seer.</hi> Therefore when they went to the <hi>Seer</hi> they went to <hi>enquire of God.</hi> That is one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance wherein GOD is ſought. But yet when GOD is not ſought in the due order in this Ordinance, it brings no bleſſing but a breach, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>To the Iewes a ſtumbling blocke, to the Gentiles fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>A ſavour of death unto death, Iſ.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>And the Word of the Lord was unto them—that they might goe, and fall backward, and be broken, and bee ſnared and taken.</hi> And be <hi>broken.</hi> There is a <hi>breach</hi> in ſtead of a <hi>blesſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 In <hi>prayer.</hi> GOD is ſought in prayer, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 21, 22. <hi>Let us go ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:260:17"/> 
                  <hi>to pray before the Lord, and to ſeeke the Lord of Hoſtes, yea many people ſhall come to ſeeke the Lord of Hoſtes in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and to pray before the Lord.</hi> That is another Ordinance wherein the Lord is ſought. But when God is ſought in prayer, and not ſought in the due order, not a bleſſing but a breach followes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 9. <hi>Let his prayer become ſinne.</hi> If our light become darkeneſſe, how great is that darkeneſſe! If our duties become <hi>ſin</hi> how great is that <hi>ſinne?</hi> A prayer turned into <hi>ſinne</hi> is a curſe, and brings a curſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In <hi>ſacrifices</hi> of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were Ordinances in which God was ſought. <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>They ſhall goe with their flockes, and with their heards to ſeeke the Lord.</hi> But yet if God were not ſought in them after the due order, there was a breach in ſtead of a bleſſing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, how much more when hee brings it in wickedneſſe.</hi> when he brings it with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:260:17"/> an heart out of order. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>I will ſpread your doung upon your faces, even the doung of your ſollemne feaſts, and ſacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 In <hi>fasting.</hi> God is ſought in it. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>I proclaimed a faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſeeke of him a right way for us. Iſa.</hi> 58. 2, 3. <hi>Yet they ſeeke mee-wherefore have wee faſted?</hi> Yet if GOD not ſought in faſting after the due order, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a breach, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>When they faſt I will not heare their cry.</hi> There is no bleſſing. But that's not all, there is a breach alſo, <hi>But I wil conſume them by the ſword, and by the famine, and by the peſtilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 In <hi>Sacraments.</hi> God is ſought in the uſe of them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 19. <hi>That prepares his heart to ſeeke</hi> GOD, namely in the uſe of the Sacrament of the Paſſeover. But yet if GOD be ſought in the Sacrament, and not after the due order, it will proove a breach; wee ſee it in <hi>Tudas,</hi> hee received the Paſſeover, the Sop was the cloſe of it, and ſee what followed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 27.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:260:18"/> 
                  <hi>And after the Soppe Satan entred into him.</hi> The Divell made a breach into his ſoule. The Soppe proved poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to him, and when hee receives it he receives the Divell. Not becauſe hee received an evill thing, for the <note place="margin">Nam &amp; nos ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die accipimus viſibile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cibum.

Tract. in Ioh. 26.</note> Paſſeover was Gods Ordinance, but becauſe, as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayes, <hi>hee being an evill man received a good thing in an evill manner,</hi> in an undue order.</p>
               <p>We ſee it in the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 3, 4, 5. All baptiſed, did all eate the ſame Spirituall meate, did all drinkt he ſame Spirituall drink, <hi>But with many of them God was not well pleaſed,</hi> there is the want of the bleſſing, <hi>for they were overthrowne in the wilderneſſe.</hi> There is the breach. We may ſee it in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29, 30. <hi>He that eateth, and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelfe, for this cauſe many are weake and ſickly, and many ſleepe.</hi> He that eates, and drinkes the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament he uſes a right Ordinance, but he that cates and drinks unworthily, he uſes it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:260:18"/> not in a right Order, and therfore not only no bleſſing but a breach followes both upon ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this Truth are theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All Gods Law is copulative, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 10. And therefore marke <hi>Deu.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. how thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are layd downe, Thou ſhalt not kill, <hi>And</hi> thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, <hi>And</hi> thou ſhalt not ſteale, <hi>And</hi> thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay as <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. Thou ſhalt not Kill, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But wee ſee one of theſe Commandements is knit to the other by the Copulative particle <hi>And.</hi> That ſame particle <hi>And</hi> is amongſt theſe Commandements as the Taches, and Loopes were amongſt the Curtaines of the Tabernacle. The taches put into the loopes did couple the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Tent, and ſew the tent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that it might bee one. <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 10, 11. So doth this particle cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:260:19"/> theſe Commandements together. Now as it is with thoſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there ſpecified, ſo it is with all the reſt, the firſt, ſecond, third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou ſhalt have no other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, <hi>And</hi> thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any graven Image, <hi>And</hi> thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine. So that the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one is the breach of the whole Law, as he that had uncoupled but one Curteine of the Tabernacle had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coupled the whole Tent. Now then the ſame Law of God that commands <hi>Ordinances,</hi> the ſame Law of GOD commandes <hi>Order.</hi> And hee that breakes the Commandement enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order whether outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, makes a breach upon the whole Law. And when we make a <hi>breach,</hi> what can wee looke for but a <hi>breach?</hi> God commandes order, even outward order, and will have it preciſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>The Prieſts ſhall lay the woode in order upon the fire, and the Priests ſhall lay the parts, the head,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:260:19"/> 
                  <hi>and the fat in order upon the woode.</hi> Not onely woode layd upon the fire, but layed in <hi>order,</hi> not onely the parts, head and fat layd upon the wood, but layd in <hi>order.</hi> And <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 9. Layd the wood <hi>in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now GOD that commandes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order, and ſtands ſo punctually upon the outward <hi>order,</hi> how much more commandes He, and ſtandes He upon inward <hi>order,</hi> the right ordering, and diſpoſing of the inward man? If God will have the wood in <hi>order,</hi> the parts of the Beaſt, the fat, and the head in <hi>order</hi> in the Sacrifice, how much more requires hee to have the Heart and Soule of a man in <hi>order</hi> in any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervice, and in the uſe of any holy Ordinance of His? As to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in that caſe, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 38. 1. <hi>Set thine houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for thou must dye.</hi> So ſet thy Soule <hi>in order,</hi> for thou muſt pray, heare the Word, receive the Sacrament. <hi>Let all things bee done decently, and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. That is a Cannon, and a Commandement for outward <hi>order,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:260:20"/> and God that will have men ſo Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall for His outward <hi>order,</hi> how much more requires He that men be as regular for inward <hi>order?</hi> Let all things be done holily, and in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>order.</hi> Let not onely the Word be heard, Gods Name be called upon, the Sacrament received, but let it bee done after the due <hi>order,</hi> with an heart, and a ſpirit ſo ſpiritually ordered as God commandes. So that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding inward <hi>order,</hi> as well as an outward Ordinance, and His Law being Copulative, ſuch muſt our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be, or elſe we make a breach in His Law, in uncoupling what he hath coupled together. <hi>What God hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together let no man put aſunder,</hi> what GOD hath coupled together, let no man uncouple. He hath coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſecond Commandement enjoyning His Ordinance, and the third enjoyning the inward manner, and <hi>order</hi> of the uſe of His Ordinance. And therefore to uſe His Ordinance without that <hi>order</hi> is a breach of what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:260:20"/> He hath coupled. And if we make a breach in His Law, what wonder if He make a breach in our ſervice, in our comfort!</p>
               <p n="2">2 That ſame, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhall it be to be accepted.</hi> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <note place="margin">Non eſt Actio bona ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter niſi omnes bonitates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currant: quia quilibet ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris defectus cauſat malum, bonum autem cauſatur ex In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra cauſa.

Now as unto that which is <hi>good</hi> ſo unto that wh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is <hi>perfect</hi> there muſt bee an entire concurrence of all requiſites. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or want of any one thing required may cauſe an imperfection, but to the conſtitution of perfection, there muſt be a meeting of all things required. It will appeare in the caſe ſpecified, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 21. The ſacrifices of Beeves, or Sheepe there mentioned muſt be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Now if the beaſt had wanted but any one part, an eye, an eare, an horne, an hoofe, any one of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects had cauſed an imperfection, and the ſacrifice had beene imperfect, and ſo no acceptance of it. But now to have made it <hi>perfect to bee accepted,</hi> it muſt have all, and every one of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:260:21"/> parts, every member of the body in its number, and proportion. Now the equity holds in all dutyes of worſhip. To what end is our worſhip, if not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi> if we will have it <hi>accepted</hi> wee muſt have it <hi>perfect,</hi> there muſt be all theſe things in it that <hi>God</hi> requires. Now <hi>God</hi> requires in worſhip, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wee uſe his Ordinance, but his <hi>order;</hi> as outward, ſo inward. Now when there is this perfection that <hi>God</hi> requires, then may a bleſſing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance bee expected. But if that <hi>order,</hi> that Spirituall <hi>order</hi> which God calls for be wanting, if wanting in any one part of it, there the duty is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there no acceptance can be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, but rather a breach.

But in more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner bee exhorted to thinke upon this, when thou art to receive the Sacrament. Men have generally an high conceit of the Sacrament, what ever eſteeme they have in the mean time of other Ordinances. And true it is, that it is a very precious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and highly to bee eſteemed; but yet ſtrange it is, to ſee what little regard men have to come in due Order thereunto. In any caſe men muſt come; and it were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wrong that could be if they ſhold not come: be they adulterers, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, ſwearers, bee their lives and wayes what they will, yet becauſe it is the cuſtome to come at ſuch a time, in any caſe they muſt come.

If the time</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>of holy Lent be come, or the day of Epiphany be come, what kinde of perſon ſoever the man bee, hee is made partaker of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. But it is not the time of comming unto them, neither Epiphany nor Lent, which makes them worthy that come, but the ſincerity and purity of the ſoule. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes come with that, never come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi> So that they lookt more at the time they came, than to come with ſincerity and purity; as if the time ſhould impart that holineſſe to them which the Sacrament requires, and they neglected to bring with them. And are not there too many in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:260:24"/> world, that nouriſh ſuch ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in their hearts, who thinke, that ſo long as they come at ſuch times as law and cuſtome ſets, all is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, there needs no more to look after. But let men know, that at what time ſoever they come, let it be ever ſo ſoleme a time, or how often ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come, were it monethly, or daily, yet if they come not after the due Order, they ſhall be ſo farre from receiving a bleſſing, that they ſhall receive a breach, yea, a very curſe upon their ſoules: let a man come as oft as he will to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet if he come not after the due Order, <hi>God</hi> will deale with ſuch a communicant as with the wicked man in that caſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 23. <hi>When hee is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall raine it upon him whileſt hee is eating.</hi> So here, when a man comes to the Sacrament, and not after the due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even whileſt he is eating, GOD may raine downe his wrath upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:260:25"/> him; and when hee thinkes to eate <hi>Chriſts</hi> fleſh, and drinke his bloud, that which he eats, may bee ſawced, and that which hee drinkes, may bee ſpiced with the bitter wrath of God. Such is the caſe oftentimes of many receivers, who will bee comming to the Sacrament without any regard to <hi>Gods</hi> due Order: as it was with the Iſraelites at their Quailes, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78. 29, 30, 31. <hi>So they did eate and were filled, for he gave them their owne deſire: but whileſt the meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of GOD came upon them.</hi> Quailes were dainty food, but wrath was ill ſawce: fleſh they muſt needs have, no remedy, and they murmure that they have it not; fleſh they have, and wrath they have. <hi>And the wrath of God came upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while their meat was yet in their mouthes.</hi> Who would have their meate to have had their ſawce? So, many will needs come to the Sacrament, by no meanes may they be perſwaded to forbeare till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted, come they muſt, there is no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:260:25"/> remedy: and they have their deſire: but while the Sacramentall meate is yet in their mouths, the <hi>wrath of God</hi> comes ſecretly and inſenſibly upon their ſoules, becauſe they come, and doe not ſeeke God after the due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. That ſame is an heavie curſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69. 22. <hi>Let their</hi> Table <hi>become</hi> a ſnare <hi>before them, and that which ſhould have beene for their wellfare, let it become a trap.</hi> It is very heavie, when our <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Table</hi> becomes a <hi>ſnare</hi> unto us; but to have the <hi>Table of the Lord</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>ſnare,</hi> and the Sacrament w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is appointed for our <hi>wellfare,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>trap;</hi> what judgement can be imagined heavier? And yet this is the ſad condition of ſuch as come not to the <hi>Lords</hi> Table after the due Order, even that <hi>holy Table</hi> becomes a <hi>ſnare</hi> unto them. How wondrous jocund and jolly was <hi>Haman,</hi> that he muſt go with the King to <hi>Eſthers</hi> banquet? <hi>Eſther</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Then went</hi> Haman <hi>forth,</hi> that day, <hi>joyfull, and with a glad heart.</hi> And he brags of it, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Yea, Eſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:260:26"/> 
                  <hi>her the Queene did let no man come in with the King, unto the banquet ſhe had prepared, but my ſelfe; And to morrow I am invited unto her alſo with the King.</hi> But little reaſon had the man to be ſo cranke; for not only at the banquet; but at the banquet of <hi>wine, Eſther</hi> 7. 7. which was the merrieſt banquet of all, hee meets with the Kings wrath, and thereupon with the ſentence of death. How happy were it, it were not the caſe of many Communicants; full brag &amp; jolly they be, that though they bee moſt unfit, yet they may come, and none can keepe them back; and to the Sacrament they will goe, that they will: but alas, at the very <hi>banquet of wine</hi> they meet with the King of Heaven, his wrath upon their ſoules, which there arreſts them, and ſentences them to death. As if <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſay, Loe, here is a company of people come to my Table, &amp; amongſt them, I ſpie a great many that are not come after the due Order: and ſhall ſuch as theſe that thus unduly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:260:26"/> ſeeke me, meet with my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? Shall theſe have my Chriſt? ſuch as theſe, ſhall they eate my ſons fleſh, and drink his bloud? No, here is not for you. <hi>God</hi> will ſay to them, as <hi>Nabal</hi> to <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 10, 11. <hi>Who is David? And who is the ſonne of Ieſſe? Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh, that I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</hi> So will the <hi>Lord</hi> ſay to all ſuch, Who are ye? and whence are ye? ſhall I take my Sacramentall bread, and my Sonnes fleſh and bloud, which I have prepared for ſuch as come after the due Order, &amp; give it unto a company of perſons, I know not whence they are? Be gone, and meddle not; or if you will needs be medling, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no bleſſing, but my curſe be upon your communicating. Therefore in the feare of GOD looke we to it, to come to this holy Ordinance in an holy Order. A great conſcience is to be made of comming. It is a grievous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:260:27"/> ſin to neglect <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance; and as great a conſcience is to be made of comming after the due Order. Be no leſſe ſolicitous to come in due Order, than to come to the <hi>Ordinance.</hi>

There ought to be no leſſe care in us comming to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, than was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Iewes</hi> to the eating of the Paſſeover. And ſpeciall care was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them for preparation, ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>So kill the Paſſeover, and ſanctifie your ſelves, and prepare your brethren.</hi> And if they were in their places to be carefull to prepare others, how much more ought others to be carefull to prepare themſelves? And that is to be obſerved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Speake unto all the Congregation of Iſrael, ſaying, In the tenth day of this moneth, they ſhall take to them every man a Lambe, a Lambe for an houſe.</hi> And Verſ. 6. <hi>And ye ſhall keep it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fourteenth day of the ſame</hi>

                  <hi>moneth.</hi> So that the Lambe was taken and ſet apart, <hi>foure dayes</hi> before it was killed. What might the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that ceremony be? what ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning it had, this might be one thing aimed at therein; to teach them what care they were to have, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themſelves for eating the Paſſeover: if the Lambe muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and be ſet and kept apart from the reſt of the flock, <hi>foure whole dayes</hi> before; then how much more were they in a ſolemne and an holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to prepare <hi>themſelves</hi> for the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Lambe? What was all that foure dayes ſeparation of the Lambe, but a continuall ſtanding-Sermon, preaching preparation to them? It was as if <hi>God</hi> had ſaid unto them, <hi>Be ye alſo prepared.</hi> It queſtionleſſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that there ſhould be a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that not a ſudden, but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſerious preparation, ſome good ſpace of time before men come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Therefore we reade, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 14.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:260:29"/> That the <hi>Iewes</hi> had a <hi>day of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and it was the <hi>preparation of the Paſſeover.</hi> And Verſ. 31. <hi>Becauſe it was the preparation.</hi> And upon that ground was that Act of theirs, In ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from comming that day into the Iudgement Hall, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28. <hi>And they themſelves went not into the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled; but that they might eat the Paſſeover.</hi> It ſhewes, that upon the day of their preparation, they were to take heed of doing any thing that might defile them, and unfit them for the eating of the Paſſeover: though it be true, that they were not in that caſe ſo carefull to keepe themſelves from morall, as from ceremoniall defilement. And if ſuch preparation were required for the eating of the Paſſeover; why then ſhould not there be as great a care at leaſt, if not greater, to come with due preparation to the Lords Supper? Is our ſacrament inferior to theirs, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, excellency, efficacy, benefit, and comfort? Nay, is it not in many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:260:30"/> regards above and beyond it? and ſhal our preparation be leſſe than theirs?</p>
               <p>When we are invited to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Tables to feaſt with them, how doe we ſpruce up our ſelves, in our comelier and cleanlier apparrell, and how much rather will we chooſe to be abſent, then to come in undecent and homely attire? When we come to the Sacrament, we come to the <hi>Lords</hi> Table, to a Feaſt of his preparing: and therefore ſhould be no leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to dreſſe, trim, and ſpruce up our ſoules, then we are to trim our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies when we goe to the Tables of men. It is a ſad thing to conſider, what little care and conſcience men generally have of this duty; and how rudely and raſhly men thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Gods preſence, and unto his Table. Many have the civility and the manners, not to offer to ſit downe at a Noblemans Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not judge themſelves perſons of that rank and quality, who are fit to ſit downe at ſuch a mans

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:260:31"/> Sacrament than at other times. But for a ſpirituall preparation of the heart, to fit it for ſo holy and ſolemne a ſervice, it is a thing that is never once lookt after nor thought upon. To quicken men then to this Duty, conſider theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>According to a mans prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſuch is his profit and benefit. God</hi> proportions every mans profit by the Sacrament, according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Sacrament. The more diligent and ſerious preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come, the greater benefit and profit when we come. Preparation is the ſeed time, receiving is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: every man reapes proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to what he ſowes. He that ſowes nothing, reapes nothing. No pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, no profit. Hee that ſowes little, reapes not much, reapes but little, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Hee that ſoweth ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, ſhall reape ſparingly.</hi> He that is ſparing and ſlight in his preparation, ſhall reape but ſlightly and ſparingly in matter of benefit: little preparation,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:260:31"/> little profit. But the more we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves, and the more time, paines, and diligence, we ſpend ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the greater benefit and comfort we ſhall meet with in receiving: for he which ſowes bountifully, ſhall reape bountifully. It is in the duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, as in the duty of praying. The more prepared the heart is to pray, the greater is a mans returne from heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Thou wilt</hi> prepare <hi>their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine eare to heare.</hi> To have our heart prepared is the due order of ſeeking God in prayer. And the more God gives a man an heart to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to pray, the more God prepares his owne eare to heare. So in the caſe of receiving; thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine hand to give. God ſo enlarges his hand, as we enlarge our hearts; and nothing furthers the enlargement of the heart more, than ſolemne preparation. Then may a man expect a liberall and plentifull bleſſing in the uſe of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:260:32"/> Ordinance, when he comes with a ſufficient preparation and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over which he appointed to be kept, could not bee kept at the appointed time, but was put off to the ſecond moneth; and the reaſon is given of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 3. <hi>For they could not keepe it at that time, becauſe the Prieſts had not ſanctified themſelves ſufficiently:</hi> which implyes, that when the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was to be celebrated, the Prieſts were not only to ſanctifie themſelves, but to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> themſelves <hi>ſufficiently.</hi> And ſo it holds good for people alſo; that when they come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt have a care not only to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> themſelves, but to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> themſelves <hi>ſufficiently.</hi> There may be an <hi>inſufficient</hi> preparation; and where the preparation is inſufficient, there cannot be expected ſuch a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meaſure of ſpirituall good, and bleſſings, as we deſire. The more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient our preparation is, the more <hi>effectuall</hi> the Sacrament ſhall be. The
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:260:32"/> 
                  <hi>efficiency</hi> of the Sacrament, is ever ſutable to the ſufficiency of our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fill the mens ſacks with food as much as they can carry,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his Steward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 1. Look how they came prepared with ſacks &amp; Beaſts, ſo they were ſent back with corne: the greater and the more ſacks they had prepared, the more Corne they carry away: if they had prepared but ſmall ſacks, and a few, they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the leſſe. A prepared heart is a veſſell that ſhall be filled at the Sacrament, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. Now the more or leſſe the heart is prepared, the greater or leſſer is the Veſſell. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſize and capacity of the Veſſell ſhall it be filled. Fill ſuch mens hearts with ſpirituall bleſſings, with vertue from Chriſt, with the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſays the <hi>Lord</hi> at the Sacrament, fill them with ſpirituall food as ful as they can hold, as much as they can carry. What a

If we carry not away as much as we would, it is our owne fault, that by preparation we did not furniſh our ſelves with a more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious veſſell. The poore pittances that many goe from the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, make them droope when they are gone. They may thank themſelves: for if <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren had brought ſmall ſacks, they could not have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away much corne out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Let men come with hearts ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as they ſhould, and they ſhall be laden and filled with as much as they can carry.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, when we come to the Sacrament, <hi>We come to meet God, and to ſerve God.</hi> We come to <hi>meet God.</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:260:33"/> Now it muſt be in caſes of meeting God in mercy; as it muſt be in caſes of meeting him when he is diſpleaſed. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> In caſes of juſtice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, God will meet with men though they prepare not; yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they prepare not; but in a caſe of bleſſing in the uſe of an Ordinance, no preparation, no meeting. They <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>1</label> that will meet God in an Ordinance muſt draw neer to him, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. <hi>Draw neere to God, and he will draw neere to you.</hi> There muſt be a mutuall drawing neer betweene God and us, if ever we will meet. If God draw neere to us, yet if we draw not neere to him, we cannot meet him. Now unleſſe we firſt prepare our ſelves to an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we cannot come neere unto him: but when prepared, then we are in a diſpoſition and qualification to come neere unto him. Marke how <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpeakes to the <hi>Levites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 31. <hi>Now ye have conſecrated your ſelves to the Lord,</hi> Come neere,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:260:34"/> 
                  <hi>and bring Sacrifices, and Thank-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>preparation</hi> of a mans ſelfe is the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of a mans ſelfe;</hi> and when by preparation a man is conſecrated and ſanctified, then may a man come neere and draw neere, and ſo meet with God. But if no preparation, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; if no conſecration, no drawing neere; if no drawing neere, no meeting with God. To the ſame purpoſe is that, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>When a stranger ſhall ſojourne with thee, and will keepe the Paſſeover to the Lord, let all his males be circumciſed, and</hi> then <hi>let him</hi> come neere <hi>and keep it.</hi> So that firſt there muſt be circumciſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt come neere. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared perſon is uncircumciſed, and ſuch an one may not come neere; and how can he meet with God that may not come neere? So when we come to the Sacrament, we come to ſerve God: it is a ſpeciall ſervice of his Name. Now no ſervice can be done to God without preparation,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:260:34"/> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him.</hi> So that if no preparation, no ſervice. Vnprepared perſons in comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doe God no ſervice at all. The very Heathens ſaw that by the light of Nature, that God was not to be ſerved at an adventure, or by the <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

Plut.</note> way; but that men ſhould come on purpoſe to worſhip him, and come <hi>prepared from their houſes.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we intend God a ſervice in the receiving of the Sacrament, Come we prepared. All Gods ſervices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a precedent preparation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a comfortable ſigne of <hi>uprightneſſe and ſincerity of heart, to prepare our ſelves religiouſly</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament: and the more forwardneſſe and readineſſe in preparation, the greater ſigne of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of heart. When the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the reſt of that ſervice of God was to be performed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. we find that Verſ. 34. The Prieſts were too few, and the Levites
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:260:35"/> were faine to helpe untill the other Prieſts had ſanctified, had prepared themſelves: but what was the reaſon the Levites were forwarder to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves than the Prieſts were? The reaſon is laid downe in the end of the Verſe, <hi>Becauſe they were more upright in heart:</hi> therefore by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it followes, that they that are moſt forward and moſt carefull to ſanctifie and prepare themſelves for the Sacrament, are the moſt ſincere and upright in heart. And as in all Ordinances, ſo eſpecially in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it is good to come with an upright heart. We come thither that it may doe us good, and that we may receive good from God in it: with the more ſincerity we come, the more may we looke for good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 4. <hi>Doe good, O Lord, unto thoſe that bee good,</hi> and to them that are <hi>upright in their hearts.</hi> God will <hi>doe good</hi> in the Sacrament to all ſuch as come to it with an <hi>upright heart.</hi> And they that come duly prepared, come with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:260:35"/>
               <p> Fourthly, no man can come ſo worthily as hee ought, nor ſo fit as he ought; when wee have prepared our ſelves the beſt that we can, yet alas, what a deale of deadneſſe and dulneſſe of ſpirit, what a deale of hardneſſe of heart will come along with us? But here now is one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar encouragement to ſeeke God in this Order of preparation. <hi>Though a man may have many wants,</hi> may come much ſhort of that he ſhould have, and be; yet if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſee that a man ſets himſelfe ſeriouſly to prepare himſelfe, and that he takes paines in the duty, that he may ſeeke God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in the uſe of the Sacrament, he will winck at, beare with, and paſſe by many failings, and they ſhal prove <hi>no hinderance at all to his profitable and comfortable receiving.</hi> Conſider that paſſage 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19, 20, 21. There were diverſe of them that had eaten the Paſſeover otherwiſe than it <hi>was written;</hi> that is indeed a fault, for that was not to eate the Paſſeover
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:260:36"/> after the due Order; and their faile was, <hi>That they had not cleanſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> they failed in ſome legall and ceremoniall purification: but yet, though they failed in outward prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet they were carefull of the inward and ſpirituall preparation of their hearts. That being done, though the other were overſlipped, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayes for them on this manner, <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepares his heart to ſeeke God, the Lord God of his Fathers, the he be not cleanſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purification of the Sanctuary.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord though theſe men have not purified themſelves with outward purification, yet in as much as they have prepared and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified their hearts, ſo long as the main and materiall thing is done, be pleaſed to pardon this faile: impute not this want unto them, neither let it be any barre to thy bleſſing, but that faile notwithſtanding, let thine Ordinance be powerfull &amp; effectuall unto them. And ſee what the ſucceſſe was, V. 20.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:260:36"/> 
                  <hi>And the Lord</hi> hearkened to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and healed the <hi>people.</hi> And Verſ. 21. There followed great gladneſſe of heart in the people, <hi>they kept the Feaſt of unleavened bread with great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> See then how gracious God is to paſſe by all wants and weakneſſes, to heale them and hide them, when people are carefull of the maine, to <hi>prepare their hearts</hi> to ſeeke God in an Ordinance. There followes gladneſſe and joy of ſpirit upon it, that was a ſigne of Gods being wel pleaſed with them. And that is ever the fruit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; a prepared heart ſhall be a joyfull heart. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 35, 36. <hi>So the ſervice of the houſe of the Lord was ſet in Order. And Hezekiah rejoyced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people.</hi> Here was Gods <hi>ſervice</hi> ſet in <hi>Order,</hi> and Gods <hi>ſervants</hi> ſet in <hi>Order,</hi> their hearts prepared and ſet in Order; and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>all the people rejoyced.</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:260:39"/> any mans bloud, yea, to bee guilty of a wicked mans bloud, how much more then to be guilty of the bloud of the Sonne of God, of the bloud of God? <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me, O Lord, from bloud-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> cryes <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. It is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavie thing, to have an hand in mans bloud.

Then how much more will he do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon men that are guilty of Chriſts bloud? and how much more will he require his Sons bloud at the hands of reaſonable creatures, that by unprepared receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, make themſelves guilty of it? <hi>Iudas</hi> his great ſinne, for which, his ſoule and his memory is everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accurſed, was the betraying of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud, the betraying of <hi>Chriſts</hi> bloud; his ſin was, That he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the bloud of the Lord. The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſin of the <hi>Iewes</hi> which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with ſo much indignation to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and deteſt, it was the ſhedding

Why then in the feare of GOD take heed of comming to the Sacrament unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly.

Bloud is a crying ſin, take heed above al things of having bloud cry againſt thee; but eſpecially take heed of having Chriſts bloud cry out againſt thee.

Why then are they called <hi>vaine obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> becauſe they were to them in the uſe of them but vain. Then a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>vaine,</hi> when there is no profit in it. Things are vaine things which are unprofitable things, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Vaine things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit.</hi> That is a vaine thing, that yeelds not a man fruit anſwerable to his paines and endeavours. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 20. <hi>And your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vaine, for your Land ſhall not yeeld her increaſe, neither ſhall the Trees of the Land yeeld their fruits:</hi> They ſhould uſe their ſtrength in tilling and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

So here, when a man ſhall uſe Ordinances, come to the Sacrament, and they doe not nor can profit him: when a man comes to the Sacrament, and it doth not yeeld its increaſe and its fruit, then is the Sacrament vaine to ſuch a man: and then the Sacrament yeelds not fruit, when men come unprepared unto it; for want of preparation was the thing that made their oblations vaine, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18.

               <p>But yet this is not all. It is bad
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:260:44"/> enough to receive no ſpirituall good by receiving the Sacrament, but there is a further danger in it, there is a great deale of ſpirituall hurt received by it, when received unpreparedly.

It may be there be ſome that greatly regarde not the danger of their ſoules that yet love their healths, and lifes well enough. If Spirituall dangers will not, yet let temporall dangers make men looke about them.

               <p>For the prophaning of the Table, memorable is that divine vengeance <note place="margin">

It followes now to conſider <hi>what this preparation is,</hi> or wherin it ſtands. The preparation required before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is twofold. <hi>Habituall</hi> and <hi>Actuall: Habituall preparation</hi> ſtands in the having of all ſuch diſpoſitions and graces, as qualifie a man for the worke of receiving. <hi>Actuall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſtands in the exciting and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:260:54"/> of thoſe graces and diſpoſitions, and renewing of them when a man is to receive. Both theſe muſt be done by him that will receive in due order. It is here as in preaching. A man that will preach the Word, muſt firſt be habitually prepared for the worke, by having ſuch gifts, graces, abilities, and miniſteriall qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of learning and knowledge in the Scriptures, as are required to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh and furniſh a man for that work. He muſt be a man well read, well ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. Now though a man be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht man, and have competent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet he will not on a ſudden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtudy ſtep up into the Pulpit, take a Text at adventure and fall a preaching; but beſides his habituall preparation in the courſe of his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he will ſtudy afreſh upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Text, and for a particular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and beſtow ſpeciall paines for that particular worke; and that is <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall preparation.

There is his <hi>habituall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for preaching; he <hi>brings them out,</hi> namely by ſtudy and meditation, he gathers together things apt and fit for the preſent worke; there is his <hi>actuall preparation.</hi> And there is firſt an <hi>habituall preparation</hi> before an <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> He firſt ſtudies Arts, Tongues, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and then after ſtudies his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: his firſt ſtudy is <hi>habituall,</hi> his ſecond is <hi>actuall preparation.</hi> Though a man ſhould ſtudy a Sermon &amp; have an <hi>actuall preparation,</hi> yet if he had not ſtudied Divinity and other things needful, but wanted <hi>habitual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it would prove poore, lank, empty ſtuffe: and though a man had ſtudied Divinity, and had <hi>habituall preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> yet if without ſtudy and premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, without <hi>actuall preparation</hi> he ſhould offer to doe the worke, hee might be guilty of tempting God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:260:55"/> might make but wilde and confuſed worke of it, and might come off with a check. Neither of theſe thus prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſhould preach after the due Order: and both theſe might be as thoſe Prophets, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhall bee aſhamed every one of his viſion, when he hath propheſied.</hi> The firſt might well be aſhamed, becauſe he wanted <hi>habituall,</hi> the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted <hi>actuall preparation.</hi> He is not fit to preach that wants <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preparation:</hi> he may ſay (if called to preach) as <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>I am no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, I am an Husband-man; for man taught me to keep cattell from my youth.</hi> I am not <hi>habitually prepared;</hi> I have not beene trained up in the Schooles, &amp; amongſt the Sons of the Prophets, but I am a Tradeſ-man, I have beene brought up in the ſhop in a Trade from my youth: and though he be fit to preach that hath <hi>habituall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet if he want <hi>actuall preparation</hi> he is not ready to preach, not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Timothy</hi> was a <hi>ſtudied</hi> man, a man of rare and ſingular gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; and yet for all that, if he would bee an approved workeman, S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have him ſtudy to doe it: he would not have him reſt on his <hi>habituall preparations,</hi> but would have him <hi>actually</hi> fit himſelf for his work, when he was to worke. Now thus is the caſe in the Sacrament, there muſt be an habituall and an actuall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:260:56"/> to it. A man that will receive the Sacrament, muſt firſt be furniſhed with ſuch graces and diſpoſitions, as a Communicant ought to have: and though he have ſuch graces as are requiſite to habituall preparation, yet may he not therefore all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ruſh to the Lords Table, and without any more adoe receive the Sacrament: but firſt there muſt be an actuall preparing and fitting of himſelfe for the worke. Both muſt be had, or elſe no due order in the worke, or elſe no fruit from the duty. There be, that in their faſhion do act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually prepare themſelves that yet are voide of thoſe graces that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to habituall preparation. And there be that are habitually prepared, and yet faile in an actuall fitting of themſelves. To both theſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament proves as <hi>Iobs</hi> brooks to the Travellers, <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 19. 20. <hi>The troopes of Tema looked, and the companies of Sheba waited for them,</hi> as hoping by the waters of thoſe brookes to have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:260:57"/> beene refreſhed, but <hi>they were confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe they had hoped, they came thither and were aſhamed;</hi> becauſe they came with an hope to have found water in thoſe brookes: but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dried up with the heate of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, their hope was diſappointed, and ſo they went away aſhamed of their loſt labour. So both thoſe ſorts of people come to the Sacrament, there they looke and wait for ſome ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all refreſhment by it; but they may goe away aſhamed, becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and their hope is fruſtrate; they meet with no ſuch thing as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for. And the reaſon of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment is that which is ſpoken in another caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 8. <hi>The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</hi> The wedding was <hi>ready,</hi> but the gueſts were not <hi>ready.</hi> So the Sacrament is <hi>ready,</hi> and God <hi>ready</hi> in the Sacrament to do his part, but theſe kinde of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants are not <hi>ready,</hi> either not <hi>ready</hi> by an <hi>habituall,</hi> or not ready by an <hi>actuall</hi>

                  <hi>preparation,</hi> and becauſe not <hi>ready,</hi> not <hi>worthy;</hi> and becauſe not <hi>worthy,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their hopes diſappointed. Now though both theſe be required, yet <hi>habituall preparation</hi> muſt bee in the firſt place; for no man can indeed <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually</hi> fit himſelfe, till he be habitually prepared; and in vaine is all <hi>actuall preparation</hi> where <hi>habituall</hi> goes not before it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>habituall preparation</hi> therfore, ſtands in having the ſoule furniſhed with all ſuch graces and diſpoſitions as may make a man worthy, that is, fit for the Sacrament. And thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are theſe,

               <p>All theſe muſt a Communicant be qualified with, that in the Sacrament ſeeks God in due Order, and the want of any of theſe makes him guilty of not ſeeking God after the due Order.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt thing then that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:260:58"/> is <hi>knowledge.</hi> The Apoſtle makes this a great fault in receiving the Sacrament, ſo to receive it, <hi>as not to diſcerne the Lords body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſhould be a mans care, ſo to come, as to diſcerne the Lords body. This <hi>Diſcerning</hi> ſtands in knowledge, underſtanding and judgement, of the nature, uſe, and neceſſity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; the which, becauſe they cannot be known without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the fundamentall principles of religion, therefore under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords body, is included and comprehended a convenient and competent meaſure of knowledge of all the grounds of Religion: and that ſuch knowledge is neceſſary for every one that deſires to come after the due Order, will appeare by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>God prizes knowledge more than the outward acts and performances of his ſervice.</hi> Yea, ſo highly prizes knowledge above outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:260:58"/> that if it ſhould needs be that one muſt be wanting, the knowledge of God (without publike performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) is more acceptable than publike performances, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I deſired the knowledge of God more than burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> Poſſibly the caſe might be ſo that a man could not offer ſacrifice, as it was with <hi>David</hi> in his exile, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the knowledge of God he might be ſaved. But if a man did Sacrifice and offer Burnt-Offerings, yet if he had not the knowledge of God hee could not be ſaved. There may bee caſes in which a man cannot come to receive the Sacrament, but yet a man having the knowledge of God hee may be ſaved. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternall to know Thee, &amp;c.</hi> But let a man receive the Sacrament ever ſo often, yet if he be voide of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, he cannot be ſaved; <hi>For God will haue all men to be ſaved, and come,</hi> he ſayes not to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>but to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. So that as in that caſe, ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:260:59"/> in this I deſired knowledge of <hi>God</hi> more than receiving of the Sacram<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Men commonly deſire the receiving of the Sacrament more than the knowledge of God. But our deſires ſhould be ſuitable to Gods deſires. As he deſires ſo ſhould we deſire, and he deſires the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings, and ſo by pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portion more than Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, a man ſhould ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe for the Sacrament, as he would prepare himſelfe for his death, look how he would be loth to goe to his grave, ſo ſhould he be loth to go to the Lords Table. A man that would die comfortaby, would die with the knowledge of <hi>God;</hi> and a man that would receive comfortably, would receive with knowledge. It is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to die without knowledge. If a man die without knowledge, I know but one way with him. It is threatned as an heavie judgement, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 36. 12. <hi>They ſhal die without knowledge.</hi> And that is an heavie ſaying. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 21
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:260:59"/> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall die in your ſins,</hi> that is, ye ſhall die in a damned condition. Now to die without knowledge, is all one as to die in our ſins, for queſtionleſs he that dies in ignorance dies in his ſins, and ſo dying without knowledge, dies in a ſtate of damnation. And if ſo fearefull to die without knowledge, how fearefull to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without knowledge? For what makes a man unfit to die, makes him unfit to receive; and what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is dangerous to die in, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is dangerous to receive in. A man is not fit to receive, that is not in a ſtate of ſalvation, as no man is fit to dye that is not in ſuch a ſtate: we are not in a ſtate of ſalvation, but ſo far forth as we have the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Therefore</hi> no <hi>ſalvation</hi> but where there is the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</hi> No knowledge then, and not yet in the ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and what have we to doe with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:260:60"/> the Sacrament that not in the ſtate of ſalvation? That man that is fit for the Sacrament, and duly prepared for it, is fit and prepared for Heaven; and that man that is unfit for Heaven, is unfit for the Sacrament, and that man is unfit for Heaven that is without the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly conſider what is <hi>the end of our comming to the Sacrament.</hi> The end of our comming is to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in his Ordinance. And therefore there is a neceſſity of comming with knowledge. He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes comfortably and profitably to the Sacrament, who therein hath communion with God: and one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall way to have communion with him, is to have the knowledge of him, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4 7. <hi>I will give them an heart to know me that I am the Lord, And they ſhall bee my people, and I will bee their God:</hi> when we are his people, and he our God, then we have communion with him; and this cannot be that he ſhould be our God and we his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:260:60"/> 
                  <hi>till we know him.</hi> We have nothing to do with the Sacrament, nor with fellowſhip with God therein, till we be his people, and his people we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, till we have an <hi>heart to know him.</hi> A man will not have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with any with whom he hath not acquaintance, with ſuch as are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to him. We doe decline famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with ſtrangers: where the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is not, there men are ſtrangers to God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. being <hi>alienated</hi> eſtranged <hi>through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them.</hi> And ſo, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, no fellowſhip with God: no knowledge, no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to what end is it to come to the Communion without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God? A Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Communion with God, is but a comfortleſſe Communion. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire to have Communion with God when wee come to the Communion, ſo come with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Knowledge it is true that a man may have, and yet have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:260:61"/> with God, but Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God can no man have unleſſe he have knowledge. A man is not fit to <hi>partake of the Sacrament</hi> till he be fit to partake of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and that which is required to make a man fit for the <hi>participation of the covenant,</hi> is no leſſe required to make a man fit for the <hi>participation of the Sacrament.</hi> Now knowledge is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the <hi>participation</hi> of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. <hi>For this is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant I will make—for all ſhall know mee from the least to the greateſt.</hi> That which is required to make us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the covenant, is required to make us fit for communion with <hi>God;</hi> and that which is required to make us partakers of the covenant, muſt needs be as much required to make us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſeale of the Covenant. Such a neceſſity of knowledge there is in him that receives the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, conſider, how utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfit a man is, whileſt he is in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. That appeares in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:260:61"/> 1 Firſt, No man is fit to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the <hi>ſeale</hi> of the covenant, who is not in the covenant of grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ſay that he is ſo. Ignorant perſons cannot ſay that they are in the covenant of grace; for ſuch as are in the covenant of grace have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>an anointing, which teaches them of all things.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27. And they that be effectually called are <hi>taught of God, Iohn</hi> 6. 45. And they that are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God they all <hi>know him from the least of them to the greateſt of them, Ier.</hi> 31. 33, 34. Therefore they that <hi>know not God,</hi> that are not taught of God, they that are not <hi>anointed,</hi> are not in covenant with God. Such are all ignorant perſons; they be perſons unanointed, they be perſons untaught of God, they know not God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they not in covenant with God, and being not in covenant have nothing to doe with the Sacrament: for in the uſe of the Sacrament there is a ſealing of the covenant unto us. Now a man can have no right to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:260:62"/> have the covenant ſealed unto him, till he be in the covenant; and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons are not in covenant with God: ſo that the ignorant mans recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, is but the having of a ſeale to a blanke. And what is a man the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that? What is a man the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for having the Kings broad-Seale to a Parchment that hath nothing written in it? He hath nothing but a peece of Parchment and wax, he hath neither land nor living, ſealed and conveighed to him thereby. Iuſt ſo it is in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, none have any benefit by the Sacrament, but ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and actual members of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Sacrament is ſpirituall food, and all the members of Chriſts body receive nouriſhment, and growth by the uſe of this food, but yet they muſt bee members of the body, or elſe no nouriſhment, growth, or life. Ignorant perſons are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all members of Chriſts body. They are captives of <hi>Satan,</hi> faſt in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:260:62"/> clutches and poſſeſſion. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26. They that know not the truth are in the <hi>ſnare of the divell,</hi> and <hi>are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive by him at his will.</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the very power of the divell. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To turne them</hi> from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>to light, from</hi> the power <hi>of Satan unto God.</hi> That which is called <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in the firſt, is called the <hi>power of Satan</hi> in the latter clauſe; ſo that the divell having, and holding a man in ignorance, hath, and holds him in his power. And are ſuch the members of Chriſts body that are wholly in the power and poſſeſſion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell? Have they any thing to doe to participate of Chriſts body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that are no members of his myſticall body? Are ſuch as are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſlaves, vaſſals, and captives, fit to come to the Lords Table, and have fellowſhip with the God of heaven?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, an ignorant perſon is utterly unfit for the Lords Table. <hi>God</hi> forbad to offer the <hi>blinde;</hi> the <hi>blinde</hi> was an <hi>abomination</hi> to him. And what
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:260:63"/> difference betweene a <hi>blinde offering,</hi> and the <hi>offering of the blinde.</hi> A <hi>blinde offerer</hi> that hath the eyes of his mind out is worſe, and more abominable then a <hi>blinde offering.</hi> The Law denyed a Leaper the benefit of civill Society, therefore much more of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion in publike ſervices and ſacrifices. Now an ignorant perſon is a kinde of leaper, he hath one perillous ſymptome of leaproſie, namely that ſame, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 44. <hi>The Prieſt ſhall pronounce him utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, his plague is in his head.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a man hath a plague in his head he is utterly uncleane, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee ſhut out of the campe. <hi>verſe</hi> 46. Much more therefore from holy ſociety. An uncleane man is not fit to come to the Lords Table, and every ignorant perſon having a plague in his head is uncleane, and therefore unfit for the Lords Table. There bee two things that ſhew an ignorant perſon unfit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:260:63"/> 1 We judge <hi>fooles</hi> and <hi>children</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Sacrament, and that upon that ground, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe.</hi> Becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not examine themſelves; for by the Apoſtles rules whoſoever cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and try himſelfe ought not to come to the Sacrament.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 We all confeſſe that he is not fit to come to the Sacrament that comes with an <hi>ill minde, Prov.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, how much more when hee bringeth it with a wicked minde?</hi> At the beſt it is loathſome, but when brought with a <hi>wicked minde</hi> it is worſe by farre. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perſons uſe to pleade for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and underſtanding which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, and cannot anſwer as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, yet they hope they have as <hi>good meanings,</hi> and come with as <hi>good mindes</hi> as the beſt. Thus ſilly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures delude they themſelves, and their owne ſoules. Alas what talke you of your <hi>good meanings,</hi> and your <hi>good mindes?</hi> Are not your <hi>mindes ignorant?</hi> Have ye not <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mindes?</hi> Why then be it knowne unto you that your <hi>mindes are naught,</hi>

               <p>Therefore let all ignorant people be adviſed to take heede what they doe. It is woefull to conſider the groſſe ignorance of many Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, it would pity a mans heart, and make his ſpirit bleede to ſee how many come to the Sacrament, and yet are utterly to ſeek in the very grounds of Religion. They heare of Chriſt, and they ſee a Sacrament, but what, or who CHRIST is, what is the end and uſe of a Sacrament, they know no more then ſuch as have ſcarce heard of CHRISTS Name. In the feare of God looke to your ſoules, and get ſome competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the knowledge of God, and CHRIST, before you offer to medle with ſo holy an Ordinance. Eſpecially let ſuch looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeles as may be taught, and inſtructed, and yet in a wilfulneſſe, and rebellion of ſpirit will not be taught, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:260:65"/> that they may be fitted for the Sacrament, but will continue in their ignorance, and willfully come to the Sacrament therein. As the LORD ſpeakes to ſuch perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the taking of the Covenant in their mouth, ſo it may be ſaid of taking the ſeale of the Covenant into their mouthes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. <hi>What hast thou to doe that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt instruction,</hi> ſo in this caſe, what haſt thou to doe that thou ſhouldeſt take <hi>the ſeale of my covenant</hi> into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and refuſeſt, and ſcorneſt to be taught, and be holpen out of thine ignorance.

The <hi>Iewes</hi> were very carefull, and preciſe to performe the outward rites of Gods worſhip, to bring their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſacrifices and the like.

                  <hi>of your ſacrifices?</hi> Why? did not God Himſelfe command them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them? And doth God uſe to enjoyne things to <hi>no purpoſe? Who hath required</hi> this at your hand, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Who but God Himſelfe? Did not he <hi>require it,</hi> and charge them to doe it? Is God weary of his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Doth he hate his owne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and are his owne ſervices bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to himſelfe? It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed but all theſe ſervices were of his owne appoyntment, he himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them of them, he commanded ſacrifices, incenſe, oblations, but he withall commanded them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after the due order. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver required theſe things to be done in <hi>that order</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> they did them. It was to <hi>no purpoſe</hi> to offer multitudes of ſacrifices in <hi>that order</hi> they offered them, he hated their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done in <hi>that order</hi> they did them. Why after what order did they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them? <hi>Not after the due order,</hi> for they did theſe things <hi>without</hi>

                  <hi>faith,</hi> and came to God in their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and therefore it is that God thus conteſts with them.

So that all that came to theſe ſacrifices, and ſervices without faith waſhing themſelves in CHRISTS bloud came not in due order. So it is in the caſe of the Sacrament. Come without faith and God will ſay unto you, To what purpoſe is your frequent receiving of the Sacrament? To what purpoſe is the multitude of your <hi>Communions?</hi> Who hath required this at your hands to ſit downe at my Table? Come no more at the Sacrament, yee trouble me, I am weary of your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,</hi> and your receiving, it is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:260:67"/> But let us get faith, and waſh and ſprinkle our ſelves with Chriſts bloud, and then will God ſay, <hi>come now.</hi> This is to come after the due order: Now that you come after the due order, come, and welcome. No man ought to come till he come in due order, and no man can come in due order till hee come waſhed in CHRISTS bloud, and there is no being waſhed in CHRISTS bloud but by faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neare with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodyes waſht with pure water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſaw before that Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and order muſt goe together. We muſt come to the Sacrament, that is, Gods Ordinance, but wee muſt come with faith, that is Gods order. As it is an heynous <hi>ſinne</hi> to neglect Gods Ordinance, ſo it is no leſſe hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and dangerous to neglect, and contemne Gods order, and Gods due order is, that every Communicant
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:260:68"/> come prepared with faith. So that it is no leſſe <hi>ſinne</hi> nor danger to come without faith then not to come at all. He <hi>ſinnes</hi> dangerouſly that comes not at all. He <hi>ſinnes</hi> as dangerouſly that comes, and yet comes without faith. Conſider againe that ſame paſſage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 4, 5. There were ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to that feaſt that came not. <hi>They made light of it,</hi> what tell you them of CHRIST, of the excellencies to be had in CHRIST, to be had in the Word, or miniſtery of the Goſpel, or in the Sacrament? They made light of it, but was this a <hi>light ſinne?</hi> They found it an <hi>heavy ſinne</hi> to them in the end, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Well after this there is a ſecond and a freſh invitation, and the wedding was furniſhed with gueſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. The feaſt being furniſhed the King comes in to ſee and view his gueſts, and one he ſpyes that had not a wedding garment. The man was come, he was not guilty of the contempt of the Ordinance, but yet was guilty of the neglect of <hi>Gods</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:260:68"/> order. In he was come, but not after the due order. Well, but what is his entertainment? <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wedding garment, verſe</hi> 12. that is, how haps it that thou art come in, and not after the due order? That was a queſtion that ſilenced him, ſmote him ſtarke dumb. But yet that is not all. See <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Take him, binde him, &amp;c.</hi> and do but compare that with the ſeventh <hi>v.</hi> and doe but conſider which of the two <hi>verſes</hi> ſound ſadlieſt. And ſee that it is no leſſe dangerous to neglect Gods order then his Ordinance. But wherein was his neglect of the due order? Not having a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, not having faith, or the righteouſneſſe of faith. He that coms to the Sacrament without his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, comes not after the due order, and he that comes to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without faith comes without his wedding garment. Doe but conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der foure ſpecialties in that parable, that will ſerve to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:260:69"/> 1 When the ghueſts were come in, the King comes in to ſee them. So doth the Lord with all that come to the Sacrament. Take notice of that, all ye that come to the Sacrament; When you are come together unto the Table of the Lord you have one that comes in to overlooke you, and to view you, that comes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining ſearching eye, Let a man, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>examine himſelfe,</hi> and ſo let him eate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is great reaſon why a man ſhould ſo do, for when we come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Lord will come in to ſee, to ſearch, <hi>to examine</hi> his ghueſts. <hi>God</hi> is not ſatisfied that men come to his Ordinance, but <hi>God</hi> will <hi>examine,</hi> and ſee whether they bee come after the due order. If indeed <hi>God</hi> ſhould not come in to ſee his ghueſts, then might they be the more remiſſe, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but beleeve it hee will come in and ſee them and looke narrowly on them too, and therefore I thinke it neerely concernes men to looke to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:260:69"/> themſelves, and to ſee to it before they come, that they come after the due order.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The whole houſe was full of ghueſts, and there was amongeſt them all but onely one man that wanted a wedding garment. In ſuch a crowd, and company one would thinke that happily one might have skulked, and have lyen hid, and not have been ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and yet that one man was not hid, but was found out. So if but one man come to the Sacrament, and come not after the due order, <hi>God</hi> wil finde him out. The crowd and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude cannot hide him from <hi>Gods</hi> eye.</p>
               <p>And if one could not bee hid in a multitude, how much leſſe ſhall twenty, forty, or more bee hidden from him?</p>
               <p n="3">3 That his fault was the want of due order in comming, and his want of due order was his want of faith. So not a man comes to the Sacrament without faith but <hi>God</hi> ſpies him, and ſingles him out with this queſtion,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:260:70"/> friend how cameſt thou in hither, not having the grace of faith?</p>
               <p n="4">4 That this man not comming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the due order with faith to that feaſt meets with a breach, and a blow, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. Such will the caſe be of all ſuch as come to the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith. Is is nothing to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>God?</hi> To be ſmitten dumbe? Is it nothing to bee <hi>bound hand and foot,</hi> and be caſt <hi>into utter darkeneſſe?</hi> If this bee any thing then it is ſome thing to come to <hi>Gods</hi> ſupper without a wedding garment. He that comes in without a wedding garment <hi>on his backe</hi> ſhall not go out without chaines and <hi>fetters on his feete.</hi> So that all this conſidered, we ſee how neceſſary it is that he that will come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in due order muſt come with faith. And that we may yet be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convinced of the neceſſity of bringing faith with us, conſider theſe things following.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, a mans greateſt care ſhould be ſo to come to the Sacrament, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:260:70"/> his comming and his performance of the duty ſhould be acceptable. As good abſent as preſent without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: who cares to come to his neighbours table, unleſſe he may be welcome? Who had not rather bee abſent than be lowred upon, and to be entertained with ſowre and darke cloudy lookes? now it is not poſſible to finde acceptance without faith. No mans performance of any ſervice is acceptable till his perſon be accepted, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>I have no pleaſure</hi> in you, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſts, neither will I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an offering at your hand:</hi> Why would he not accept their offering? becauſe he had <hi>no pleaſure in them.</hi> He was not pleaſed with their <hi>perſons,</hi> &amp; therefore not pleaſed with their <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> he had no pleaſure in their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> therefore no pleaſure in their <hi>performances.</hi> It is the acceptance of the perſon, that makes the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance acceptable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>God had reſpect to Abel and his offering:</hi> firſt to <hi>Abel,</hi> and then to the <hi>offering</hi> for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:260:71"/> 
                  <hi>Abels</hi> ſake. If God had not had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> he would not have had reſpect to his <hi>offering;</hi> as in <hi>Cains</hi> caſe, Verſ. 5. <hi>But unto Cain and his offering he had no reſpect.</hi> But becauſe God likes <hi>Abel,</hi> therefore he likes his <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> But what is it now that will bring our perſons into acceptance, that God may take pleaſure in us? That very thing that brought <hi>Abels</hi> perſon into acceptance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain:</hi> ſo that the way to bring our perſons into accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is to bring faith: faith is it which makes the perſon acceptable; leave that behinde, and our caſe will be theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4, 5. <hi>They did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meat, and they did all drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke, but with many of them God was not well pleaſed.</hi> So we may eat and drink the outward elements in the Sacrament, but if we do it not with faith, God is not well pleaſed with us; and being not well pleaſed with us, neither will
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:260:71"/> he be well pleaſed with our ſervice. It was ſpeedy acceptance that <hi>Daniel</hi> had in his prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>At the beginning of thy ſupplications the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came forth, &amp;c.</hi> And what was the ground of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that ſo ſpeedy? <hi>for thou art greatly beloved.</hi> When a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in favour and beloved of God, then followes acceptance. The way to get acceptance, is to get our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beloved: the way to get our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beloved is to get them into Chriſt, the way to get them into Chriſt, is by faith. <hi>This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son in whom I am well pleaſed. God</hi> is well pleaſed with no man till he be in Chriſt; no man is beloved but in his beloved Sonne. And when once we are in Chriſt, purged, and purified by his bloud, then our ſervices are performed in righteouſneſſe, and when ſo performed, then accepted, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>He ſhall purifie the Sonnes of Levi;</hi> namely Chriſt by his bloud, <hi>that they may offer unto the Lord an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:260:72"/> 
                  <hi>in righteouſneſſe, Then ſhall the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Iudah and Ieruſalem be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto the Lord.</hi> And what is it that will bring us into Chriſt, but the grace of faith? As therefore wee would have acceptance at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo come in due Order, Come with faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, for what end come we to the Sacrament? Is it not that we may be partakers of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud? The Apoſtle ſpeakes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Of being partakers of one bread,</hi> and Verſ. 21. <hi>Of being partakers of the Lords Table.</hi> Now, will this ſerve our turne, and ſatisfie us to be <hi>partakers</hi> of the Bread, of the Wine, of the Table; or doe we not aime at an higher matter, namely to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Christ himſelfe? Heb.</hi> 3. 14. We may partake of the bread and the wine, we may be partakers of the Table, though not a dram of faith in us. But that which priviledges us to be partakers of Chriſt, of his body and bloud, is faith. We come to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:260:72"/> Sacrament to be made partakers of Chriſts body and bloud, but this we cannot doe, nor may do till we have faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>we cannot doe it;</hi> for he that will receive Chriſts body and bloud, muſt have an eye to ſee Chriſt and his worth, muſt have a foot to come to Chriſt, muſt have an hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and lay hold upon him, muſt have a mouth to feed on him; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all theſe there is no <hi>partaking of Christ.</hi> Now faith is all theſe. It is the eye of the ſoule, <hi>Iſay</hi> 17. 7. <hi>At that day ſhall a man looke to his maker, and his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of Iſrael. Iſay</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth.</hi> It is the <hi>foot</hi> by which we come to Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35. <hi>He that commeth to me ſhall never hunger, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and beleeving are the ſame, faith being that by which we come to Chriſt.

                  <hi>received him,</hi> that is, <hi>to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in him.</hi> Beleeving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame, becauſe by faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt. It is the <hi>mouth</hi> by which we <hi>feed</hi> on him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud,</hi> that is, except ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt. Now, can a man ſee without an <hi>eye?</hi> come without a <hi>foot?</hi> receive without a <hi>hand?</hi> feed without a <hi>mouth?</hi> GOD hee lookes that when he offers CHRIST, men ſhould receive him, and takes it ill when it is not done. <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body:</hi> Chriſt therefore would have us <hi>eat</hi> him in the Sacrament. <hi>God</hi> is never better pleaſed, than when he ſees men fall hungerly and hartily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt: nothing diſpleaſes Him more, than when the Bread of Life, the fleſh of Chriſt ſhall be ſet before us, and we ſit and looke another way, and feed not and fall not to. When a man makes a feaſt, if he ſees his gueſts fall too, and feed hard, how highly well it contents him; but if hee ſees
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:260:73"/> them ſit looking about them, and not to feed upon thoſe diſhes he hath bin <note place="margin">Quomodo igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur corpus Chriſti edent, &amp; ejus ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem bibent, cum &amp; illud non habeant quo ſolo haec edi &amp; bibi poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt? <hi>Gualib.</hi> in 1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> at ſo much coſt and care to provide, it troubles and frets him. Therefore if a man would pleaſe God in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he muſt feed and partake of Chriſt. Now therefore a man muſt bring faith: he cannot feed that hath no <hi>mouth,</hi> he hath no <hi>mouth</hi> that hath no <hi>faith.</hi> Chriſt is a treaſury of rich commodities, there is any thing to be had in him we want, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 18. There is <hi>gold</hi> to be had <hi>tried in the fire,</hi> there is <hi>white raiment,</hi> there is <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> to be had. But now, how may theſe be had, what is the way to get them? There Chriſt tels us, <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me gold, white raiment, eye-ſalve.</hi> The way to get them then, is to buy them. But what is that which will buy them? Not money, not ſilver, <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Buy Wine and Milke without money, and without price:</hi> no money of the worldlings, no price of the merit-monger will purchaſe theſe commodities. And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:260:74"/> yet there is a <hi>money</hi> wee muſt trade withall if we will <hi>buy</hi> them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot be had; and that coine is faith: faith is that alone which <hi>buyes</hi> thoſe riches of <hi>gold, white raiment, &amp;c.</hi> faith is it that makes us partakers of Chriſts benefits. Hee that goes to mercate and carries no money in his purſe, cannot <hi>buy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that he wants. To come to the Sacrament, or Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and bring no <hi>faith</hi> with us; is to come without a penny in our purſes; and if we come without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, we ſhall be ſent back without commodity. So that without <hi>faith</hi> we cannot be <hi>partakers</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>we may not doe it.</hi> We may not doe it till wee have right to eat of Chriſts fleſh, and drinke his bloud; and right we have none till we have <hi>faith.</hi> None had right to eat of the fleſh of the ſin-Offering, but the Prieſts; only they might eat it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. 26. The Prieſts onely had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:260:74"/> right to eat the <hi>ſhewbread, Lev.</hi> 24. 9. <hi>It ſhall be Aarons and his ſons, and</hi> they ſhall eat it <hi>in the holy place, Marke</hi> 2. 26. <hi>Which is not lawfull to eat but for the Priests.</hi> It is ſo here. None may eat the fleſh of Chriſt who is our true ſin-offering but they that be Prieſts; till we be Prieſts we have no right to it, we muſt be Prieſts before we can have this priviledge. But what is the way to be made Prieſts? To be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Chriſts bloud, as the Prieſts were conſecrated by being waſht in water, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 6. By <hi>waſhing</hi> alſo are we made Prieſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 5, 6. <hi>He hath loved us, and waſht us in his own bloud,</hi> and made us Prieſts. But how come wee to bee waſht in Chriſts bloud? That is done by <hi>faith, faith</hi> takes Chriſts bloud, and ſprinkles and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the conſcience therewith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. and being waſht by <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi> bloud wee are made Prieſts. And therefore wee are ſaid to bee <hi>made Prieſts by faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 4, 5. <hi>To whom ye comming</hi> ye are alſo an <hi>holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:260:75"/> that is, you beleeving are made Prieſts, for to beleeve is to come, and to come is to beleeve. And ſo <hi>faith</hi> making us Prieſts doth give us right to eat of theſe holy things, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges us to be <hi>partakers</hi> of Chriſt. Since therefore wee cannot eate and <hi>partake</hi> of Chriſt till we have a right, and we have no right till Prieſts, and no Prieſts but by faith; therefore no right to partake of Chriſt till we have <hi>faith.</hi> And therefore if wee would come to the Sacrament after the due Order, ſo as to eate of Chriſt, and be partakers of him, we muſt come with <hi>faith.</hi> It is not after the due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for any but <hi>a Prieſt to eat the fleſh</hi> of the ſin-offering, or the <hi>ſhew-bread.</hi> It was a caſe extraordinary that the ſhew-bread was given to <hi>David,</hi> and the men with him to eat.</p>
               <p>We may not eat Chriſts fleſh, and drink his bloud till we have a right to it; we have no right to it, till we be of <hi>Gods family</hi> and <hi>houſhold.</hi> The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Chriſts fleſh and bloud
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:260:75"/> therein, is the bread and food which God provides for thoſe of his owne houſehold, and not for ſtrangers and foreiners: for wee finde mention, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>of the houſehold of God,</hi> and they there ſtand in oppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>foreiners and strangers.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. there is mention of the <hi>houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith.</hi> When we are of the <hi>houſehold of faith,</hi> we are of the <hi>houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God;</hi> and when we are of <hi>Gods houſehold,</hi> we may eat his <hi>houſehold proviſions;</hi> when we are of Gods <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> we may eat <hi>his bread.</hi> But till we be of his family we have no right to his proviſions. We had need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have <hi>faith,</hi> to make us of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> that ſo wee may bee of Gods family, and may have right to his proviſions.</p>
               <p>They that will have right to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament, they muſt be firſt Gods children; <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and give it unto dogs, Mat.</hi> 15. It is not a good Order in a family that dogs ſhould eate the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:260:76"/> the bread that is provided for his children; offall and ſcraps are good enough to feed dogs withall; if they get upon the Table, and meddle with childrens bread, they ſhall bee ſet downe again with a whip or a cudgel. So here, the fleſh of Chriſt is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, and we have no right to it till we be children, and children we are made by <hi>faith, Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as beleeved he gave them this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to become the Sons of God. Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> And ſo by <hi>faith</hi> being children, have a right given us to partake of this bread of life. So that to come without faith is not to come after the due Order: which is, that none eate Chriſt, and be made partakers of him, but ſuch as by <hi>faith</hi> are made the children of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Give not holy things to dogs,</hi> that is not the due Order, that is a diſorder. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till we have <hi>faith</hi> God forbids to meddle with the Sacrament; and if in this undue Order we wil be medling,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:260:76"/> looke for a check. God will ſay to ſuch in this caſe, as he did to <hi>Adam</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had eaten the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt eaten of the Tree of which I commanded thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eate of it, curſed is the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it, &amp;c.</hi> So becauſe thou eateſt the Sacrament of which God hath commanded thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eate of it till thou bring faith, therefore in ſorrow ſhalt thou eate, it is ſmall comfort thou ſhalt have in thine eating.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, conſider the evils that follow upon comming without <hi>faith,</hi> and in our unbeleefe. And they are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, ſuch as come without faith, are not welcome to God: for ſuch as come to the Lords Table with their perſons, and conſciences defiled cannot be welcome. We ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 6. that there were certaine men who were <hi>defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keepe the</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:260:77"/> 
                  <hi>Paſſeover.</hi> What if they had in that defilement come to the Paſſeover? They had to themſelves <hi>defiled the Paſſeover.</hi> For holy Ordinances doe not <hi>ſanctifie defiled perſons,</hi> but defiled perſons <hi>defile holy Ordinances,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the reſolution of that caſe, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. <hi>An uncleane perſon by a dead body, touching the bread or wine, makes them uncleane.</hi> It is not ſafe to defile Gods Ordinances. We know what was the voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Peter</hi> in his viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 15. <hi>What God hath cleanſed, call thou not, and ſo make thou not common.</hi> A defiled perſon comming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, makes a <hi>cleanſed thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Now an unbeleeving perſon is a perſon defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Vnto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled nothing is pure;</hi> no, not the pure Ordinances of God. <hi>Every word of God is pure, Prov.</hi> 30. 6. And ſo his Sacraments are pure. But to a defiled perſon, neither of theſe pure. Well then, who are they now that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:260:77"/> are defiled ones? See the words of the Text, <hi>to them that are defiled and unbelieving.</hi> Therefore an <hi>unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> perſon is a <hi>deſiled,</hi> and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſon. <hi>Faith purifies the heart, Acts</hi> 15. 9. and ſo fits for pure Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but unbeliefe defiles the heart, and a defiled heart defiles <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance to it ſelfe. And how can that man bee welcome to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, welcome to a Sacrament, that defiles it?</p>
               <p n="2">2 To come without faith makes our comming an abomination. To come without faith is to come out of Chriſt, and to performe the ſervice which a man doth, out of CHRIST. Now all ſervice performed out of Chriſt, is <hi>abominable</hi> to GOD. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 3, 4. <hi>What man ſoever there be of the houſe of Iſrael that killeth an Oxe and a Lambe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And brings it not to the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer an offering to the</hi> LORD, &amp;c. <hi>bloud ſhall be imputed to that man: he hath ſhed bloud, and that</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:260:78"/> 
                  <hi>man ſhall be cut off from among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And againe <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall ſprinkle the bloud upon the Altar of the Lord at the doore of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſhall no more offer their ſacrifices unto divels.</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices then not brought to God to the <hi>doore</hi> of the Tabernacle were as <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>bloudſhed,</hi> were as the ſervice of the Divell. And what more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before God? The doore of the Tabernacle was a Type of <hi>Chriſt. Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>I am the doore.</hi> And the drift of that Law is to teach that they ſhould performe all their ſervices to GOD in CHRIST, and to ſhew how loathſome to GOD all ſervices are that are not done in him. Now he that is in his unbeleefe, that wants the grace of faith is not in <hi>Chriſt</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he doe any thing in Chriſt. And therefore ſuch a mans comming cannot but be an abomination. God abhors, and abominates that man, and his comming that wants faith. The end of comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:260:78"/> is to ſeeke, and ſee Gods face, and to have fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. Now if we come without faith God will not let us ſee his face, GOD will turne away and hide his face from us, <hi>Deu.</hi> 32. 19. 20. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw it hee abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he ſayd, I will hide my face from them.</hi> But why will <hi>God</hi> do ſo? He gives his reaſon for it, <hi>for they are children in whom is no faith.</hi> So that when a man hath not faith he ſhall not ſee GODS face in the uſe of his Ordinance, for how can a man ſee an <hi>hidden face?</hi> But that is not all, GOD not onely <hi>hides his face,</hi> but he <hi>abhorred</hi> them. He abhorred them becauſe of their <hi>provoking</hi> him. How did they <hi>provoke</hi> him? Not onely by that ſpoken of in the <hi>verſes</hi> going before, but by that alſo in the <hi>verſe</hi> following, becauſe they were <hi>children in whom was no faith.</hi> Such then as have no faith have no communion with GOD, and doe provoke God ſo as he abhors them.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:260:79"/> There can bee no communion with GOD where a man is cut off from God, and fellowſhip with him. And where a man is <hi>cut</hi> off from <hi>covenant</hi> he is <hi>cut</hi> off from <hi>communion.</hi> Now where there is no faith there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a <hi>cutting</hi> a man off from God, and <hi>covenant</hi> with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Through unbeleife they are cut off.</hi> And beſides it is a <hi>provoking ſinne.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever lives in a ſin that continually provokes <hi>God. Numb.</hi> 14. 11. <hi>How long will this people provoke mee? And how long will it be yer they beleeve me?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 21, 22. <hi>The Lord was wroth, ſo a fire was kindled againſt Iacob, and anger alſo came up againſt Iſrael, becauſe they beleeved not in God.</hi> And what wonder then that a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament without faith is abomination to GOD, when his unbeleife angers and <hi>provokes</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſtate of unbeliefe is a ſtate of ſpirituall death. <hi>I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. A belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:260:79"/> is a <hi>living man,</hi> an unbeleever a <hi>dead</hi> one, ſpiritually dead. The want of faith in the ſoule is the death of the <note place="margin">Vnde mors in anima? quia no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt fides; unde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mors in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? quia non eſt ibi anima<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ergo animae tuae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima fides eſt. <hi>August. in Ioh tract.</hi> Placuit ut cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus defun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtia no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> detur.

It was an ancient abuſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to give it to dead bodyes, an abuſe condemned and caſt out by a Councill upon this reaſon: <hi>Becauſe</hi> CHRIST; <hi>ſayes Take, Eate: But car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, and dead bodies can neither eate, nor drinke.</hi> It was a good reaſon to deny it to dead bodyes. The very ſame reaſon excluds unbeleevers. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers are dead, unbeleevers can neither eate nor drinke, for beleeving is eating &amp; drinking, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 53. What ſhould a man doe at the Sacrament that can neither eate nor drinke CHRISTS fleſh and bloud? An unbeleever can doe neither, becauſe he is a <hi>dead man,</hi> becauſe hee wants faith, the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>teeth</hi> by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be eaten.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Vnbeleife evacuates, enervates, and de-ſorces the Sacrament of its
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:260:80"/> efficacy, and vertue, or powerfull operation. The Sacrament in <hi>Gods</hi> Inſtitution, is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> that hath a fulneſſe of ſpirituall bleſſing in it, full of efficacy, and ſpirituall power, and offers to empty it ſelfe with a rich, and plentifull bleſſing upon the ſoule of the receiver. But yet provided, that hee come to receive it after the due order, that hee come prepared with a beleeving heart. And Chriſt ſayes to every receiver, as he ſayd to the Centurion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>As thou hast beleived ſo be it done unto thee,</hi> and as to the blinde man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 29. <hi>According to your faith bee it unto you.</hi> So in this caſe, as you beleive, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your faith when you come to the Sacrament, ſo bee it done unto you. According to your preparation with faith ſo ſhall mine Ordinance worke, and be effectuall, and empty out it ſelfe unto you. And as every man brings faith, ſo hee carryes away an anſwerable portion of bleſſing, and ſpirituall good from the Sacrament.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:260:80"/> But now when a man comes to the Sacrament in unbeliefe, voyde of the grace of faith, the Sacrament proves but a dead Ordinance, utterly ineffectuall, utterly empty of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good. That looke as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes of CHRIST to them in caſe of circumciſion, and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the workes of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you that if you be circumciſed Christ ſhall profit you nothing,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 4, <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect unto you who ever of you are justified by the Law.</hi> So it may be ſaid of the Sacrament, and CHRIST in the Sacrament, behold, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaies it unto you that if you come to the Sacrament, and to CHRIST in the Sacrament and come in your unbeliefe: Without faith that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Sacrament ſhall <hi>profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> CHRIST and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>becoms of no effect</hi> unto you who ever of you come in the ſtate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. Vnbeleife freezes up, bindes, and lockes up the vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:260:81"/> and CHRIST therein. It is ſtill with <hi>Christ</hi> in the Sacrament, as it was with him in that caſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 5, 6. <hi>He could there doe no mighty worke,</hi> and the reaſon is rendred in the next <hi>verſe, Hee marvelled becauſe of their unbeliefe.</hi> So that their <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe</hi> did in a manner <hi>binde</hi> CHRISTS hands. It is ſayd <hi>verſe</hi> 2. that the aſtoniſhed people ſayd, <hi>What wiſedom is this which is given unto him, that even ſuch mighty workes are wrought by his hands.</hi> And yet it is ſayd that he could there doe no <hi>mighty worke.</hi> CHRIST was a CHRIST that could doe <hi>mighty workes,</hi> and yet there could doe no <hi>mighty worke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their unbeliefe. He could not doe any mighty thing; why? can any thing limit the mighty power of CHRIST? Not ſo; but he could not, becauſe this is the order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which alone hee hath tyed himſelfe to worke, and be efficacious by, namely that he will exert, and put forth his <hi>mighty power</hi> in, and unto
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:260:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe that beleeve, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Vnto you that beleeve he is pretious.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>pretious</hi> in himſelfe, but not <hi>preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and efficacious to us, but ſo farre forth as we <hi>beleeve, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>The exceeding greatneſſe of his power, and the working of the might of his power is towards them that beleeve.</hi> So that if no faith on our part, no exerting nor putting forth of his power on <hi>Chriſts</hi> part. So it is here. The Sacrament, and CHRIST in the Sacrament doth <hi>mighty workes.</hi> There is a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty efficacy</hi> in the Sacrament. And yet it can doe no <hi>mighty worke</hi> in many, it can doe no <hi>worke</hi> at all in many for their good, becauſe of mens unbeliefe which enervates the Sacrament, and deads the force and operation of it to unbelieving hearts. The Sacrament is pretious, powerfull, and efficacious to them that beleeve, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment received <hi>without faith</hi> is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>without force,</hi> and <hi>without fruit.</hi> A <hi>faithleſſe</hi> is a <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> receiver. Looke how it is with the Word, ſo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:260:82"/> is it with the Sacrament. Great things are ſpoken in the Scriptures of the power, and efficacy of the Word. No where more then <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>The Word of God is quicke and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp;c.</hi> And yet in the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter the Apoſtle tels us that it was <hi>powerleſſe</hi> to ſome, and wrought not with them. But what was the matter? <hi>For unto us was the Goſpell preached as well as unto them, but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> Though the Word in its owne nature were powerfull, yet their unbeliefe made it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Iuſt ſo in the Sacrament, though it be a powerfull Ordinance to doe great things in the ſoule, yet the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament adminiſtred doth not profit many becauſe it is not received with faith, and mens owne unbeliefe makes it powerleſſe unto them.

As the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were to waſh themſelves, ſo ſome parts of the Sacrifices alſo were to be waſht, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>But the inwards and his legs he ſhall waſh in water.</hi> The ſame Order muſt be obſerved in comming to the Sacrament: every ſinner is an uncleane perſon, and uncleane ones muſt be waſhed before they offer to have fellowſhip with the GOD of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:260:86"/> Purity. There is a double waſhing with which wee muſt bee waſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can come in due Order. Firſt the waſhing of our ſelves in Chriſts bloud by faith. And ſecondly the waſhing of our ſelves by repentance. He that will come in due Order, muſt waſh by repentance as well as by faith: yea, he muſt waſh both his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and his feet. His <hi>inwards</hi> muſt be waſht, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Waſh thine heart, O Ieruſalem, how long ſhall thy wicked thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> All inward and ſecret luſts muſt be waſht out by repentance. And the feet muſt bee waſht alſo. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 10. As we walke in our daily wayes; we gather a great deale of ſoile, and this ſame ſoile of our outward actions, muſt alſo bee waſht away by repentance. Why muſt the inwards and the feet or legs of the Sacrifices be waſht, above all the reſt? The reaſon is given, becauſe the inwards or intrailes, are the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that containe the filth and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Beaſt; and therefore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:260:87"/> were they to be waſht. And the legs <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">CHAP. </seg>5</label> or feet to be waſht, becauſe they tread in the dirt, and mire, and ſo are more defiled then any other part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And all this was to teach, that when wee draw neere to God, wee ſhould ſpecially waſh there where moſt filth is readieſt to bee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Our inwards, our hearts and conſciences, what abundance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements and filth have they? what dunghils of filthy luſts lye in our hearts? our legs, our feet, how doe we defile them by walking and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in foule wayes? <hi>Even he that is waſhed already,</hi> ſtill and daily needs to have his <hi>feet waſhed, Iohn</hi> 13. 10. Now then for us to come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with ſuch <hi>inwards,</hi> with ſuch <hi>feet,</hi> is not to take heed to our <hi>feet,</hi> nor to come in due Order. It were diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to ſit downe at a mans Table in ſo ſlovenly a faſhion, as with unwaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en hands; therefore more diſorderly to ſit downe at the Lords Table with unwaſhen hearts. The Phariſees
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:260:87"/> quarrelled with our Saviours Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Why</hi> (ſay they) <hi>doe thy Diſciples tranſgreſſe the tradition of the Elders? for they waſh not their hands when they eat bread.</hi> But to ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants as come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without repentance, it may be ſaid upon better ground, <hi>Why doe ye tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the commandement of the Lord?</hi> For yee waſh not your hands, nor your hearts, when ye eat bread at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is indeed a thing worth the inquiring after, becauſe many that come to the Sacrament that yeeld to it that there muſt be a preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, yet fouly deceive themſelves in their repentance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it ſtands in a ſorrow for ſin, and an actuall <hi>renouncing</hi> and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin, ſo as to have no further communion with it. And here is that wherewith many gull themſelves, do

Marke there who did eat the Paſſeover: not all, not every man that would, but only ſuch as had repented, and ſo had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves for it. How did their repentance appeare? by their actuall ſeparation of their ſinnes from them, <hi>All ſuch as had ſeparated themſelves from the filthineſſe of the Heathen of the Land.</hi> It had beene an hainous and horrible thing for them to have come to the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> in the filthines of the Heathen. But they onely that did ſeparate themſelves from that filthineſſe of the heathen did eat. Thus muſt it be alſo with a man that will eat at the Sacrament; it is not enough for him to confeſſe his ſinnes, to ſhed ſome teares and blubber for them, but he muſt ſeparate himſelfe from the filthineſſe of the heathen. What is ſwearing, whoring, drunkenneſſe, profanation of the Lords-day and other Holy-dayes but the filthineſſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:260:90"/> of Heathens? What are theſe but heatheniſh filthineſſes? Therefore whoſoever is polluted with any ſuch filthineſſe, or the filthineſſe of any other ſin, muſt firſt ſeparate himſelfe from that filthineſſe before he come to the Lords Table. Let a man ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe from his filthineſſe, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup. And the way to ſeparate our ſelves from our filthineſſe and ſins, it is by repentance. Sin ſeparates us from God, but repentance ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſinne from us, and ſo fits us for fellowſhip with GOD in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>And this is that thing which was typified in purging out of leaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſeover, <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. 15.

And the <hi>Iewes</hi> were exceeding preciſe in purging out leaven. We reade <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 14. of the <hi>preparation of the Paſſeover,</hi> which was the day before the Paſſeover. Now on that day the father of the family, with other men lighted wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candles, ſearched all corners to purge out all remnants and crums of leaven. And their Scribes taught, that a man was to ſearch after leaven in <hi>ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and in <hi>corners,</hi> and to ſearch it out by the light of a candle out of all <hi>holes and corners.</hi> So that a <hi>Iew</hi> before the Paſſeover would not have left a <hi>crum of leaven</hi> in a crany, or blinde corner of his houſe.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:260:91"/> have to purge out, and caſt out all our ſinnes before we come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was no <hi>Iewes</hi> houſe had ſo many darke holes, blinde corners, and crannies, as have our hearts, and therefore wee ſhould take the light, and candle of the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Thy word is a light, a Lampe;</hi> And by the light of this candle ſearch and ranſcke the blinde corners and ſecret crannies of our hearts, and out with all the very crums of <hi>leaven.</hi> So that as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in that caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven. Therefore let us keepe the feaſt, not with old leaven, &amp;c.</hi> So let us doe in this caſe of comming to the Sacrament. This is to keepe our Paſſeover after the due Order. If we will eat of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> we muſt have no <hi>leaven:</hi> if <hi>Lambe</hi> no <hi>leaven,</hi> if <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> no <hi>Lambe:</hi> if Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no ſins and luſts favoured; if ſins and luſts favoured, no Chriſt. There bee that expound that Text, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 2. of the two Sacraments,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:260:91"/> 
                  <hi>Thy navell is like a round goblet which wants not liquor, thy belly is like an heap of wheat, ſet about with Lilies.</hi> By the <hi>navell</hi> they underſtand the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme: the navell ſerves for the nouriſhment of the babe in the wombe, and baptiſme nouriſhes infants and new borne babes in the Churches wombe. By the <hi>belly like an heape of wheat,</hi> they underſtand the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, for the aboundance and ſtore of excellent ſpirituall nouriſhment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and marke with what this heape of wheat is ſet about, ſet about <hi>with Lilies,</hi> ſignifying Chriſtians of holy and godly life. To be ſure, ſuch they ſhould bee by repentance that come to this Sacrament, they ſhould be <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> pure and white; <hi>Lilie-white,</hi> that are ſet about this <hi>heape of wheat.</hi> It is not after the due Order when ſtinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>weeds, hemlock, nettles,</hi> and ſuch traſh are ſet about this <hi>heape of wheat,</hi> when ſcandalous and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, common ſwearers, cuſtomary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:260:92"/> drunkards, &amp;c. thruſt in, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves downe at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>It is a caſe much to be lamented to ſee the deſperate boldneſſe of many in comming to the Sacrament; ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, habituall drunkards, uncleane perſons, make no more bones of comming to the Table of the Lord, than of ſitting downe at their owne ordinary Tables: ſweare this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the next, be drunke on the eve, and receive the Sacrament on the morrow. Herein dealing as the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot in that caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20. <hi>She eats and wipes her mouth, and ſaith, I have done no wickedneſſe,</hi> I am as honeſt a woman as the beſt of my neighbours. So theſe eate and drinke at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>wipe their mouthes,</hi> and who hath any thing to ſay to them, they hope they are as orderly faire Communicants as the beſt. That therefore men may bee awakened to bee more conſiderate, and may bee provoked to come prepared with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, let them a little thinke ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:260:92"/> on theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee that comes to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not after this order, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Repentance, ſhall be ſure to meet w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> no bleſſing, benefit, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. There is a great deale of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy to bee had in the uſe of the Sacrament, provided a man ſo come to it as he ought, provided that a man come prepared with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Marke that paſſage, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6, 22. <hi>They kept the Feaſt of unleavened bread ſeven dayes with joy.</hi> What are civill Feaſts <hi>without joy?</hi> and what are holy Feaſts <hi>without joy? A Feaſt is made</hi> for laughter, <hi>and wine makes merry, Eccl.</hi> 10. 19. Little comfort in this Feaſt, and Wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſſe it make a mans heart merry and joyfull. Ioy is that which GOD promiſes to the right uſers of his Ordinances, <hi>Iſay</hi> 56. 7. <hi>I will make them joyfull in mine houſe of prayer.</hi> So God makes men joyfull in the houſe of <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>joyfull at the Table of his houſe.</hi> They kept the Feaſt <hi>with</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:260:93"/> 
                  <hi>joy.</hi> How ſo? <hi>For,</hi> (ſayes the Text) <hi>the Lord had made them joyfull.</hi> But obſerve who they were whom <hi>God</hi> made joyfull at that Feaſt, and Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: namely, thoſe who had <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from the filthineſſe of the heathen of the land.</hi> Such as come with true Repentance, God makes joyfull in the uſe of his Ordinance. A man may be bold to challenge impenitent perſons that come in their ſinnes, and to charge them with it, that they have no joy in their receiving: God <hi>joyes</hi> them not, makes them not welcome.</p>
               <p>As in the Goſpell, ſo at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God makes a Feaſt, ſuch a Feaſt as the Feaſt of the Goſpell is, <hi>Iſay</hi> 25. 6. <hi>A Feast of fat and ſweet things, a Feast of Wine, a Feast of things full of marrow.</hi> But who muſt eate of that Feaſt, who muſt be feaſted with that wine and marrow? How muſt they bee prepared that eat of this Feaſt? They muſt come in due Order that come to that Feaſt; and that due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to come with repentance: for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:260:93"/> marke what God ſubjoynes there, Verſ. 7. <hi>And I will deſtroy the face of the covering, &amp; the veile that is ſpread, &amp;c.</hi> So that they that will be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that Feaſt, muſt firſt have the <hi>veile</hi> &amp; the <hi>covering</hi> taken away; they that come veiled and covered come not after the due Order, and therfore ſhall not taſte of the ſweetes of this Feaſt. But what is that veile then that muſt be taken away, before they ſhall eat of that Feaſt? We may ſee what it is by that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. The <hi>veile</hi> is the hardneſſe of mens hearts, and that <hi>veile</hi> is taken away when men turne to the Lord. Repentance takes away that <hi>veile:</hi> when men are humbled for their ſinnes, and doe truly repent, then is the <hi>veile</hi> taken away. And when the veile is taken away, then are men prepared to come to that Feaſt of fat things. The Sacrament is a Feaſt of fat things alſo, and they that will come to this Feaſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt come with their hearts
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:260:94"/> unveiled. It is a Feaſt of <hi>fat things,</hi> but they that will eat of this Feaſt of fat things, muſt not come with <hi>fat hearts.</hi> They that come with <hi>fat hearts</hi> will finde it a Feaſt of <hi>leane things;</hi> will finde neither ſweet nor comfort in the uſe of the Sacrament; <hi>Goe make the heart of this people fat, Iſay</hi> 6. that is, Goe make their hearts hard, and impenitent; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 70. <hi>Their heart is fat as greaſſe;</hi> fat hearts ſhall not be feaſted with theſe ſweet things. <hi>A leane heart</hi> that mournes, that pines, that grieves for ſin, that heart ſhall eate of theſe <hi>fat things. Pſal.</hi> 22. 26. <hi>The poore ſhall eate, and ſhall bee ſatisfied.</hi> The man that is humbled and abaſed, he ſhall eat unto ſatisfaction: ſo that they onely have benefit (taſte the ſweet and the marrow in this Feaſt, that come prepared with repentance. But let a man come without repentance and humiliation, and he receives no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at all at the Sacrament, but findes a leane and a drie Feaſt of it. It is in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:260:94"/> this caſe with a man, as it was with the Prodigall, when once he came to himſelfe, and was ſoundly humbled for his folly, and fals to confeſſion, <hi>Father I have ſinned against thee, and againſt heaven,</hi> then ſee what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22, 23. <hi>bring hither the fatted Calfe, let us eate and bee merry.</hi> Now that he repents, he is fed, and feaſted with <hi>fat things;</hi> the <hi>fat Calfe</hi> muſt be killed and prepared. But look upon him in his impenitency, whileſt he is in his ſinnes, and how fares hee then? alas, he then eats husks, feeds with the Swine, and his belly not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led neither: whileſt he was in a Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh condition, he was fitter to feed at a Swines trough, than to feed at his Fathers Table; and then he is fed with nothing but with empty huskes. It is juſt ſo here. If men come to God and to his Table with confeſſion and contrition of ſpirit, with true and ſound repentance; then God ſayes, <hi>Come bring the fatted Calfe,</hi> make a Feaſt, give this repenting ſinner my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:260:95"/> Sons fleſh and bloud, his ſpirit; let him eat <hi>marrow,</hi> glut his heart with the comforts of my ſpirit, with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and goodneſſe of Chriſt. But when men come in their ſwiniſh and brutiſh luſts, come no better than Swine without repentance for their ſins, then GOD ſends them to the <hi>trough:</hi> What doe you a company of ſwiniſh adulterers, and drunkards, at my Table? get you to the <hi>trough;</hi> the <hi>trough</hi> is fitter for you than the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table.</hi> And though ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their impenitency will thruſt and crowd in to the Lords Table, yet they ſhall be fed but with husks. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſons find their food in the iſſue no better: they receive but the huske of the Sacrament, bare Bread and Wine, the naked Elements, they never taſte a whit of the fatted <hi>Calfe,</hi> they eate not a whit of CHRISTS fleſh and bloud. God feeds Swine onely with huskes, huskes are good enough for Hogges. And what are impenitent perſons better than Hogs
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:260:95"/> to whom Pearles muſt not bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Obſerve how the Prodigals father ſpeakes to him after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance, <hi>Come bring the fatted Calfe, let us eate and bee merry.</hi> A man can never ſo eate at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to bee merry, till hee eat of the <hi>fat, Nehemiah</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Goe your way,</hi> eat the fat, <hi>and drinke the ſweet, neither bee yee ſorry,</hi> that is, be you merry and joyfull; <hi>eating the fat, and drinking the ſweet,</hi> cheeres and makes the heart merry. But when ſayes his father, let us eat and bee merry? Now after hee ſaw his Sonne to bee ſorry, when hee ſaw his ſoule humbled and afflicted with ſorrow for his ſinnes, he ſaw him truly penitent; Now let us eate and bee merry. It is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to eate at the LORDS Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſſe wee may ſo eate that wee may bee merry, that wee may bee cheered, refreſhed, rejoyced. Now hee that would eate and bee merry at the LORDS Table,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:260:96"/> 
                  <hi>Lords</hi> Table muſt weepe and be ſorry in his owne private Chamber, and Cloſſet. And when we have made our ſelves ſorry God will make us merry, when we have ſadded our ſoules by repentance, God will glad them with the comforts of his Spirit diſperſed to us in the Sacrament. And the greater our ſorrow is before we come, the greater will our mirth be when we be come.</p>
               <p>But contrarily when we come to the <hi>Lords</hi> Table, and have not beene ſorry, have not beene humbled, have not repented, then may we come and eate, but we cannot eate, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we can have no comfort, no joy in our receiving, becauſe GOD feeds us in ſuch a caſe with nothing but huskes. Huskie food will never make the heart merry, and where repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is wanting it makes the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proove to a man no better then an husky banquet.</p>
               <p>Where repentance is wanting a man in receiving receives nothing but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:260:96"/> bare bread, and bare wine, neither is it any more with God then if a man did eate common bread, and drinke ordinary wine at his owne Table. It is in Sacraments as it was with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. When men came to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and offerings without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſee how God eſteemed of them; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>For their bread for their ſoule ſhall not come into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zanch. in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> 
                  <hi>The bread for their ſoule,</hi> that is, the bread for their life, their daily bread for the ſuſtinance of their bodily life. He ſpeakes of that meate offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. 5. That meate offering was appointed of God for a ſpirituall uſe, and yet it is called the bread for their life, or livelihood. Becauſe they uſing thoſe Ordinances without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though the meate offering were appointed for a ſpirituall uſe, God eſteemed no other then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meate, as their ordinary bodily bread they fed upon to ſuſteyne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life. In the ſame ſenſe it is that <hi>Iere.</hi> 7. 21. the Lord in a kinde of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:260:97"/> ſcorne calls their ſacrifices fleſh; <hi>Put your burnt offerings unto your ſacrifices, and eate fleſh.</hi> There wanted repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the offerers, and therefore God reckons them but as other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fleſh in the Shambles. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, what had they more at their meate offerings then at their owne Tables? what at their ſacrifices more then might have beene had at the Shambles?</p>
               <p>And no wonder, for God intends not his Ordinance to ſuch; God calls not, invites not ſuch, and he will not welcome thoſe whom he invites not. Conſider thoſe Canons which were for eating the Paſſeover. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. <hi>This is the Ordinance of the Paſſeover, there ſhall no ſtranger eate thereof. But every mans ſervant that is bought for money when thou haſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed him, then ſhall he eate thereof. A forreyner, and an hired ſervant ſhall not eate therof.</hi> Here be three Canons. Firſt <hi>no ſtranger</hi> muſt eate thereof. Suppoſe he had, yet ſurely ſhould he
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:260:97"/> have had no Communion with God, God would have beene <hi>a ſtranger</hi> to him. Secondly <hi>no hired ſervant muſt eate thereof,</hi> ſuppoſe he had, certainly God would not have accepted his ſervice. Thirdly <hi>no uncircumciſed one muſt eate thereof.</hi> If an uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſon had eaten thereof could he have looked for a bleſſing? Now all theſe three Canons make againſt an impenitent ſinners comming to the Sacrament. For an impenitent ſinner is all theſe. He is <hi>a ſtranger</hi> to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 3. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the wombe.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54. 3. <hi>David</hi> calls the <hi>Ziphims</hi> who were notwithſtanding of Iſrael, <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> for what ſo eſtranges a man from God as doth ſinne? He is an <hi>hyred ſervant,</hi> a ſervant to Satan, and his luſts, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Whoſoever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinne is the ſervant of ſinne,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>They themſelves are ſervants to corruption, for of whom a man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, of the ſame he is brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> And who will ſet his <hi>ſervant</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:260:98"/> at his Table with him? <hi>The ſervant abides not in the houſe for ever, Iohn</hi> 8. 35. and therefore ſits not down at <hi>Table</hi> at any time. He is an <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſon, Iere.</hi> 4. 3, 4, <hi>Breake up the fallow ground, circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, and take away the fore skine of your heart.</hi> What is the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, but the breaking up of the fallow ground, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. So that a repenting heart is a <hi>circumciſed heart,</hi> and contrarily an impenitent is an <hi>uncircumciſed heart, Acts</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Ye ſtifnecked, and uncircumciſed in heart.</hi> So that an impenitent perſon is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed perſon. And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that an impenitent perſon meets with no bleſſing at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he comes to eate againſt the Canon, being a <hi>stranger,</hi> a <hi>ſervant,</hi> an <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> perſon?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites Manna</hi> was Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and there is <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, and in the uſe of the Sacrament the <hi>Lord</hi> gives that <hi>hidden Manna, Apoc.</hi> 2. 17. But it is to be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:260:98"/> obſerved that the Iſraelites did not eate <hi>Manna</hi> preſently ſo ſoone as they were out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but firſt of all <note place="margin">Sicut populus Iſrael ante tranſitum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris nonpotuit manna come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, ſic ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo valet ante baptiſmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus redemto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris accipere. <hi>Anſelm. in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

There muſt be a <hi>baptiſme</hi> before the <hi>Manna</hi> may be eaten. None ought to receive the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper till he be firſt <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</hi> It were utterly againſt Gods owne order to have a man receive the Communion before he be <hi>baptiſed.</hi> That very order teaches that there muſt be repentance before we come to the <hi>Lords</hi> Table. For <hi>baptiſme is the baptiſme of repentance, Luke</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Iohn came preaching the baptiſme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> So that where no repentnace, there the Sacrament belongs not to men, and they can have no benefit
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:260:99"/> by it, to whom it belongs not. As in that caſe <hi>Bethſheba</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 6, 7. <hi>Give ſtrong drinke to him that is ready to periſh, and wine to thoſe that be of heavy hearts, or bitter of ſoule, let him drinke, and forget his poverty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his miſery no more.</hi> So it holds good here, God would not have this wine to be given to every man, it is not for profane, and impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to drinke this wine, but when men are by repentance in poverty of ſpirit, bitterneſſe of ſoule, heavie in heart, then the <hi>Lord</hi> would have this wine given them; and ſuch as come to drinke it with ſuch hearts, they ſhall have their hearts cheered, refreſhed and ſweetely comforted againſt the ſenſe of their poverty, and miſery. Repenting ſinners goe away with the ſweetneſſe, and comfort of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Prophet ſpeakes of a <hi>cup of conſolation</hi> that was wont to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſome, <hi>Iere.</hi> 16. 7. That cup of conſolation was not given to every one. But when any had buried ſome
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:260:99"/> deere friend, and was in heavineſſe and ſorrow, mourning and in bitterneſſe as <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. Then their friends did invite them to their houſes, and give them a <hi>cup of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that that cup of conſolation was for ſad, and ſorrowfull perſons only, only for <hi>mourners.</hi> The cup in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>cup of conſolation,</hi> but this <hi>cup</hi> is prepared for <hi>mourners</hi> for <hi>ſin,</hi> and when men receive it prepared with repentance, then it is indeed unto them <hi>a cup of conſolation.</hi> But no cup of conſolation at al to ſuch as in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of ſpirit come to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He that comes to the Sacrament, and not after this order prepared w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> repentance, he not only meets with no bleſſing, but with a blow and a breach. And that in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such an one ſhall not onely not be the better, but farre the worſe for his receiving in his ſinnes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency. Some have a conceit that though they be ſuch ſinners as they are, yet the comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:260:100"/> will mende and heale them, and may doe them good. But ſuch are deceived, they ſhall be ſo farre from being the better, that they ſhall be worſe. That as our Saviour ſpeakes of a Phariſees Proſelyte, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. that when he was made, he was made twofold more the childe of hell then themſelves, ſo is it with impenitent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, by their receiving they make themſelves twofold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell, and the Divell then they were before, as having added both to the guilt of their impenitency the freſh guilt of the profanation of Gods Ordinance, and having doubled their hardneſſe, and increaſed their ſtrength to follow ſinne with the more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe.</p>
               <p>Such an one meetes with an heavy curſe, a ſpirituall curſe upon his ſoule, ſo as the receiving of the Sacrament ſhall doe his ſoule miſchiefe. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worke according to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition wherein they finde ſuch as receive them. Such as are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:260:100"/> ſo prove the Sacraments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. It is in this caſe as it was with the woman under Iealouſy, and ſuſpicion of uncleanneſſe, drinking the curſed waters, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 27, 28. <hi>And when he hath made her to drinke the water, then it ſhall come to paſſe that if ſhe be defiled, and have done treſpaſſe againſt her husband, that the water that cauſes the curſe ſhall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly ſhall ſwell, and her thigh ſhall rot, and the woman ſhall be a curſe amongſt her people.

So an impenitent ſoule comming to <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance in its ſins and defilement doth but turne the wholeſome nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sacrament to the feeding of its diſeaſes, and the increaſing of its owne ſorrow and miſchiefe, as the water that made the cleane woman fruitfull made the uncleane woman <hi>ſwell</hi> and <hi>rot.

               <p> Secondly, ſuch an one as comes in his impenitency ſhall meete with a breach in another kinde, with Gods heavy wrath falling upon him at the Sacrament. That ſame is a terrible Text, and worthy to be well thought upon by every man before he comes to the Sacrament, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20, 21. <hi>But the ſoule that eats of the fleſh of the peace offerings that pertaine to the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his uncleanneſſe upon him, even that ſoule ſhall be cut off from his people: Moreover the ſoule that ſhall touch any uncleane thing, as the uncleanneſſe of man, or any uncleane beaſt, or any abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable uncleane thing, and eate of the fleſh of the ſacrifice of peace-offerings, even that ſoule ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi> Their peace offerings were <hi>eucharisticall</hi> offerings. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man had defiled himſelfe, and ſhould have come, and with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe upon him have eaten of the fleſh of thoſe offerings, what had the iſſue beene? ſurely it had beene better for that man to have beene a bed, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:260:102"/> aſleepe, for that ſoule ſhall be cut off from his people, that man ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, deſtroyed by GODS hand, and from before his face, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 3 <hi>That ſoule ſhall be cut off from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> Nay marke yet further, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. That if a man did but <hi>touch</hi> any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing; uncleanneſſe of man, or beaſt, or any abominable uncleane thing, and then in that caſe after ſuch a <hi>touch,</hi> before he be clenſed ſhal offer to eate of the fleſh of the peace offering, he ſhould be cut off from his people. What? If no more uncleanneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him then came by a <hi>touch</hi> muſt he yet be cut off? Muſt he be cut off that eates but with a <hi>touch</hi> of uncleannes? What then will become of him that not <hi>touches</hi> but <hi>wallowes</hi> and <hi>tumbles</hi> in <hi>uncleanneſſe?</hi> In the <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> of whordom, drunkennes? If he muſt be cut off that <hi>touches</hi> the uncleannes of a <hi>man,</hi> what will become of him that <hi>wallowes</hi> in the <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell? If he muſt be cut off that touches but the <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> of a beaſt, then
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:260:102"/> what will become of him that is an <hi>uncleane</hi> beaſt, an <hi>uncleane adulterer,</hi> an <hi>uncleane drunkard,</hi> or any other <hi>uncleane ſinner?</hi> See how our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 12, 13. <hi>When you come into a houſe, ſalute it, And if the houſe be worthy; let your peace come upon it, but if it be not worthy, let your peace returne to you.</hi> If the Apoſtles came to an houſe that was <hi>worthy,</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſalutation the bleſſing they prayed for came upon that houſe, but if an <hi>unworthy</hi> houſe, the bleſſing fell not upon it, but returned to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. So is it in the receit of the Sacrament. When it is received, if he bee <hi>worthy</hi> that receives it, then comes a bleſſing from GOD upon a man, but if the perſon be <hi>unworthy</hi> then comes neither bleſſing, nor peace. Now who is worthy? Iudge in your owne conſciences, are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners that live, and lye in their ſins? Are cuſtomary profaners of Gods Name? Are habituall drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards? Are loathſome Adulterers,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:260:103"/> covetous earth-wormes, are theſe worthy? If theſe be worthy who then is unworthy? Either theſe, or none are unworthy. Therefore no peace, nor bleſſing can come upon them. Nay that is not all, not only no bleſſing, but a curſe ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If he will ſhew himſelfe a <hi>worthy man</hi> ſaies <hi>Salomon</hi> of <hi>Adonijah, there ſhall not an hayre of him fall to the earth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 52. but when after he carried himſelfe <hi>unworthily,</hi> it coſt him his life. If men come worthily to the Sacrament, ſo prepared by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as they ought, they meete with no hurt, but with a great deale of good. But <hi>if wickedneſſe be found</hi>

The
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:260:103"/> Iſraelites had a wondrous ſtrange minde to fleſh, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>They wept and ſaid, who ſhall give us fleſh to eat?</hi> And as great a minde have many to come to the Sacrament, but yet it fares no better with them at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, than it did with Iſrael at their Quailes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 30, 31. <hi>Whilst the meat was yet in their mouthes, the wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the fatteſt of them, and ſmote downe the choſen men of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo whileſt many have the bread and wine in their mouthes, the wrath of God comes upon them. But why ſo? Becauſe it is with them at eating the Sacrament, as it was with Iſrael in another caſe, Verſe 30. <hi>They were not eſtranged from their lusts, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the meat was in their mouthes, the wrath of God, &amp;c.</hi> So many come to the Sacrament, but are <hi>not eſtranged from their luſts,</hi> their whoring, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, worldlineſſe, &amp;c. but come in impenitency, without ſorrow, and reformation, and therefore whileſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:260:104"/> the Sacramentall elements are in their mouthes, the wrath of God comes upon them; and ſo inſtead of <hi>eating Christ</hi> they eat <hi>wrath.</hi> And all becauſe they comming in their impenitency, provoke GOD to wrath. It may be thou feeleſt no wrath for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but yet wrath may be inflicted inſenſibly on thy ſoule. And though thou feele it not, yet thou mayeſt heape and treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath. A man that brings every day but a fagot or two to the ſtack, may in time make a great heap: every day a ſtick to the pile, may make ſuch a pile, as being fired at once, will make a dreadfull fire. Thou feeleſt no wrath for the preſent, but every Sacrament thou receiveſt, thou brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a fagot to the heape, and makeſt ſuch an heape, as at laſt will make the fire ſo much the greater, &amp; ſo much the hotter at the day of wrath. And then ſhalt thou feele that wrath which now thou heapeſt up. Thou greatenſt thine heape now, and the greater the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:260:104"/> heape, the greater the fire. Now the reaſons why God thus ſadly makes a breach upon impenitent ſinners are ſpecially two.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe every impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner defiles the Lords Table, and the Sacrament. <hi>Holineſſe becomes thine houſe, O Lord,</hi> and ſo no leſſe, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becomes <hi>thy Table, O Lord.</hi> As God himſelfe is holy, ſo his word <note place="margin">Sicut ſanctum Canes non ſanctificat, nec margaritae porcos nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, ſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Canes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquinant ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, &amp; porci margaritas, confringunt.

                  </note> and Sacraments are holy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an horrible thing to polute and defile the Sacrament. Now every impenitent ſinner doth ſo. An impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner is a filthy perſon, and he befilths every thing he meddles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. He is an uncleane perſon. Now to the uncleane all things are unclean, holy things ſanctifie not them, but they pollute holy things: under the Law, an uncleane perſon defiled the Campe, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 2, 3. <hi>Put out of the Campe whoſoever is defiled, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file not their Campes.</hi> He defiled eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bed he lay on, and every thing hee ſate on, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 4. He defiled every

He defiled the Tabernacle of the <hi>Lord. Num.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>He defiled bread, potage, wine, oile, &amp;c. Hag.</hi> 2. 13. Thus an uncleane ſinners pitch touches nothing which it defiles not. He defiles Word and Sacraments, the <hi>Lords</hi> Tabernacle and his Table. Is it any wonder then that comming to the Sacrament, he meets with a breach and a curſe? <hi>If any man defile the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, him ſhall God deſtroy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. Put <hi>Table</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and it is as true; if any man defile the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, him ſhall <hi>God</hi> deſtroy, <hi>He that defiles the Tabernacle of the Lord, ſhall be cut off from Iſrael, Num.</hi> 19. 13.

And what doth that man better, that when he hath defiled himſelfe with drunkenneſſe, and with the vomit and filth of it, yet before hee hath humbled himſelfe with ſorrow for it, and before he hath utterly forſaken and renounced it, doth preſume in that filthy caſe to come to Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?

               <p n="2">2 Secondly, becauſe a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his impenitency hee brings his ſinnes along with him, and they put God in minde to doe juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. There is a prayer for their <hi>King, Pſal.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>The Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all thine offerings, and accept thy burnt ſacrifice.</hi> That is a ſpeciall thing we ſhould aime at in all our ſervices, that <hi>God</hi> would remember them, that they may come up in <hi>remembrance</hi> before <hi>God.</hi> Now when a man lies in his ſinnes, and brings them with him to any holy ſervice they will riſe up in remembrance againſt him at that very inſtant, and ſo not his ſervices but his ſins being remembred, a man ſhall not onely miſſe of acceptance,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:260:108"/> but meet with a breach and a curſe: ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>They ſacrifice fleſh for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of mine offerings, and eat it, but the Lord accepteth them not.</hi> But why did not God accept them? the next words ſhew the reaſon, <hi>now will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their iniquity:</hi> no marvell he <hi>remembers</hi> not their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> when he <hi>remembers</hi> their <hi>iniquity.</hi> And yet this is not all: he will not onely not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>but he will viſite their ſins.</hi> When iniquity comes up in remembrance, God will viſite their ſin. And when will he viſit? now will he remember their iniquity <hi>and viſit their ſin.</hi> Now will he <hi>remember</hi> their iniquity, now, even juſt now, as they be ſacrificing, and now will he viſit their ſins, even then plague &amp; ſmite them ſpiritually, when in their Sacrifices. <hi>God</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wicked mens ſinnes at all times, eſpecially when they come to him in holy duties; even <hi>then</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to the Sacrament he <hi>remembers</hi> them <hi>then;</hi> freſhly remembers them <hi>then.</hi> When GOD ſees a wicked man come with his ſins to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> he doth
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:260:108"/> (as it were) on this manner ſpeake in heaven: Behold here is a man come to the Sacrament without repentance, &amp; he thinks to do me a goodly piece of ſervice, but by no meanes do I accept him, nay, I abhor him, and am angry at his comming. I <hi>remember</hi> that at ſuch a time he was drunk, I <hi>remember</hi> that hee is an adulterer, a covetous worldling; I <hi>remember</hi> at ſuch a time how he griped, pinched, and defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his brother; I <hi>remember</hi> hee is a common neglecter of the duties of my worſhip; and now without repentance for theſe ſins, he is come to my <hi>Table,</hi> therefore now, all theſe his ſins come up a freſh in my remembrance, and he ſhall be ſo farre from being accepted, that I wil now at this very time of his receiving ſmite him with my wrath, my curſe be upon him and his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, inſtead of a bleſſing; let <hi>Satan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into him, and carry him on ſtil to all ungodlines. It is a heavie judgment to have <hi>God remember and avenge our ſins in the Sacrament.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> doth with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:260:109"/> impenitent perſons, becauſe they bring their ſinnes thither with them. Sins brought along to the ſpirituall banquet of the Sacrament, they will doe by men as <hi>Eſther</hi> did by <hi>Haman at the banquet of wine, Eſther</hi> 7. 2, 6. whileſt he is at the banquet of Wine, ſhe petitions againſt him, and ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes him; the adverſary and enemy is this wicked <hi>Haman:</hi> and Verſ. 7. <hi>the Kings wrath is up at the banquet of wine,</hi> and he preſently gives ſentence againſt him. So all the ſinnes that a man repents him not of, when hee comes to the Sacrament to come with him, and they being preſent, doe pick out <hi>that very time</hi> to accuſe him, and to ſay, This man is a drunkard, and uncleane perſon, a common ſwearer, an adverſary, an enemy to religion; even thus at the Banquet of Wine, ſin unrepented of puts in accuſations againſt men. And therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Gods</hi> wrath is kindled againſt ſuch even at the banquet of Wine, when they bring along thoſe with

This is a thing neceſſarily required. This is a truth confeſſed on all hands, that men ſhould be in <hi>charity</hi> that come to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> And many that have no great care, nor make any great conſcience of comming with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith or repentance, yet will ſeeme to make ſome ſcruple of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without charity. Yea though many will not abſtaine for their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, oathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if there be a breach, and a falling out betweene them, and others they will by no meanes meddle; though without breach of <hi>charity</hi> a man may judge of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:260:111"/> them that they are reaſonably well contented that they have ſo faire an excuſe to ſtop the mouthes of their conſciences that are ready to checke them, and quarrell with them for their neglect of GODS Ordinance. For if out of conſcience they ſcruple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament without <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> why then ſcruple they not living without it? But yet this ſhowes that men generally acknowledge that <hi>love</hi> is a neceſſary preparative to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. It is that which indeed is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all our ſervices of <hi>God,</hi> and dutyes of his worſhip. It is required in all that will pray aright, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>I will that men pray every where lifting up pure hands without wrath.</hi> Every Chriſtians care ſhould be to have his prayer like <hi>Iobs, Iob</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Alſo my prayer is pure.</hi> The way to have our <hi>prayer pure,</hi> is to lift up <hi>pure hands</hi> without wrath. <hi>Love</hi> is that which makes heart, and hands, and ſo prayer pure from the defilement of wrath. It is required in all that will heare the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:260:111"/> Word aright, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 19. <hi>They that will bee ſwift to heare, must bee ſlow to wrath,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>all ſuperfluity of maliciouſneſſe muſt be layd apart to fit for the receiving of the Word.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Wherfore laying aſide all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the Word.</hi> And ſo likewiſe no leſſe requiſite in all ſuch as will come to the Sacrament in due order.

If without love, we are neither fit to pray nor
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:260:112"/> heare, then not fit to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; for he is not fit to receive the Sacrament, that is neither fit to pray, nor heare the Word. The neceſſity of it will appeare by theſe things.</p>

               <p n="2">2 That ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>By one ſpirit wee are all baptiſed into one body, and [by one ſpirit] have beene all made to drinke into one ſpirit.</hi> The Apoſtle had ſhown before, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. that though ſome men do receive perſonall pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar gifts, yet they are given by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:260:113"/> for the good of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> The reaſon in briefe is becauſe all the whole Church is but <hi>one body,</hi> and <hi>one ſoube:</hi> and every beleever being a member of that body, whatſoever he hath, he hath it not for himſefe, but for the common good of the body. But now the queſtion might be whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all beleevers be one body, and one ſpirit or ſoule. Now therefore the Apoſtle ſhewes, and proves this unity of the Church, that all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are one body and ſoule, from the end, and effect of the Sacrament, which is to ſeale this unity. That they be <hi>one body</hi> it appeares by the Sacrament of baptiſme, <hi>for by one Spirit wee are baptiſed into one body.</hi> That they be <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> or <hi>ſoule</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, <hi>for by one ſpirit we are made to drink into one Spirit, or ſoule.</hi> Thus by both the Sacraments is this unity ſealed. Obſerve then that a mayne end, and uſe of the Supper is, that wee may be <hi>made to drinke into one ſpirit, into</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:260:113"/> the Sacrament in love and charity, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">CHAP. </seg>7</label> or elſe how ſhall the end and uſe of the Sacrament be made good? How can they be made to drink into one ſpirit, that are of two ſpirits, of two different, contrary ſpirits? it is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding requiſite that they be <hi>of one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that come to be made <hi>drinkers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſpirit.</hi> It is love that makes men of one ſpirit, and ſo fits them to bee made in the Sacrament to drinke into one ſpirit: love makes men of one ſpirit, the Sacrament ſeales this unity of ſpirit. There cannot be an unity of ſpirit ſealed, till there be an unity of ſpirit made. Now becauſe it is love that makes this unity, and this unity muſt be ſealed at the Sacrament, therfore neceſſarily muſt a man come with love that will come aright to the Sacrament, or elſe hee fruſtrates a maine end of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, as the Sacrament of Baptiſme is the Sacrament of our new birth, ſo the Sacrament of the Supper is the Sacrament of our new
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:260:114"/> life, and ſpirituall nutrition and growth. And unto it ſhould a man come, that in the right and religious uſe of it he may be ſpiritually nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and may thrive and grow in grace and goodneſſe. Now no man can grow, thrive, or be nouriſhed by the uſe of the Sacrament, that comes to it without love. The whole <hi>Church</hi> is a body, every Chriſtian is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that body; now a member that will grow in the body, and thrive, muſt neceſſarily be united to and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the body. If a member be ſeparated from the body it cannot be nouriſhed, nor grow: an hand or an arme rent or cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cannot be nouriſhed, nor grow. Nay, though a part of the body bee not ſeparated from the reſt, yet if there be but a diſlocation of a part, ſo that it be only out of joynt, it cannot thrive and proſper till it be ſet in joynt againe. So it is here in the body My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall; it is a growing body, every member thereof growes and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:260:114"/> 
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>It increaſes with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God.</hi> But how comes it to increaſe? <hi>All the body by joynts and bonds having nouriſhment ministred and knit together, increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God.</hi> So that unleſſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bee knit together by <hi>joynts</hi> and <hi>bands,</hi> it cannot increaſe by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of nouriſhment. But now what are theſe <hi>joynts</hi> and <hi>bands,</hi> and what is it that knits the parts of the body ſo together as that it increaſes? That the Apoſtle layes downe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fully, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>From whom the whole body fitly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplies, makes increaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelfe in love.</hi> Theſe words are taken and tranſlated from the naturall body, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhewes that it is in the Church, the myſticall body of Chriſt, as in a naturall body. Now in a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; firſt, there be diverſe and ſmall members which goe to the making of it up: ſecondly, theſe members
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:260:115"/> are fitly joyned and compacted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thirdly, there is a conjunction of them after an excellent manner, and that thus: all the ſeverall parts they have their bones, the ſolid parts of thoſe members. Now theſe bones are coupled by the joynts, ſo as the end and the round part of one bone goes into the hallow end of another; This is an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. But this is not all, but as the joynts are fitted and ſuited each to other, ſo as the round part of one joynes to the hallow part of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo alſo that there may be a ſure coarticulation, there be certaine liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and bonds that grow faſt to the end of each bone in the joynt, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten bone to bone, this is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. There is not only a fitneſſe by which one bone ſuites with another in the joynt, but there a faſtneſſe alſo by vertue of that bond that knits bone to bone. This is a compaction by that which both the bones in the joynt mutually miniſter: fourthly, the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:260:115"/> parts of the body thus ſweetly fitted and ſuited together, and thus firmely faſtened, they all by their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment received, thrive, and grow, and ſo the body increaſes, which it could not doe if there were a diſ-union, or a diſlocation, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They are all joyned and compact together. 3. Their conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is after the ſame manner. The mindes and ſpirits of beleevers are ſo coupled together, as that one mans ſpirit doth as it were inſinuate it ſelfe into anothers: and that this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; joynt may be the ſurer, there be certaine bonds and ligaments that knit theſe members together: and theſe bonds are two: firſt, <hi>The Spirit of God,</hi> they have all one and the ſame ſpirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>One body, one ſpirit:</hi> and by this one ſpirit Chriſtians are knit in this one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. Secondly, <hi>The bond of love, and peace;</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:260:116"/> and every joynt or member ſupplies and miniſters this bond each to other whereby they are knit each to other, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Endeavouring to keepe the unity of the Spirit;</hi> that is, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be of one ſpirit and minde, as two bones meeting at a joynt are coupled in the unity of the joynt: there is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. there is mention not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of joynts, but of bonds. And <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. love is called <hi>The bond of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> that is, a bond which doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly binde together the members of the myſticall body, each miniſtring and ſupplying love to another; as the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:260:116"/> ligaments that knit bones together are mutually miniſtred from both the bones: ſo that the compaction of the members is by the ligament of love, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. Fourthly, the body of the Church thus compacted increaſes it ſelfe, and is edified and growes up, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Maketh increaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelfe in love.</hi> The body encreaſes and edifies when the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts doe, and they doe increaſe and grow when joyned together and knit together in love. So that all this ſerves to ſhew the neceſſity of love in ſuch as come to the Sacrament; we come to the Sacrament to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to grow, to increaſe: none of theſe can be done without love. A man comming to the Sacrament out of charity, is a member out of joynt, yea, as a member diſunited. It is not poſſible ſuch a member ſhould bee nouriſhed and thrive. As therefore a man would finde nouriſhment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with the reſt of the body, ſo it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:260:117"/> concernes him to come prepared with love.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>God</hi> requires that men ſhould eat their bodily food with love &amp; mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al charity. There is little contentment in bodily Feaſts, when men ſit down at one Table with divided hearts and affections: we may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. how the Primitive Chriſtians did eat their common bread at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tables, <hi>Breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their bread with gladneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart:</hi> the which they could not have done if they had not met at their Houſes and Tables, as they did in the Temple, in the ſame Verſe, <hi>with one accord,</hi> or unanimouſly. They could not have eaten with gladneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart, if they had not eaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love. For there can be neither <hi>gladneſſe</hi> nor ſinglenes of heart where love is wanting. And if they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch love &amp; affection to their common tables to take their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repaſt, how much more think we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:260:117"/> did they come with love, and all good mutual affection one to another to the Lords Table. Therefore it was that before the Sacrament they had their love-feaſts to teſtifie with what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they came to the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> The ſweet and ſauce of common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, is love; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 17. <hi>Better is a dinner of greene herbes where love is, than a ſtalled Oxe with hatred:</hi> love makes a few green herbes farre better cheere, than the greateſt fare that is eaten with hatred and malice. If love therefore be required at our own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that when wee eate together wee ſhould eate in love, how much more then will God require it in thoſe that come to ſit downe at his Table?

               <p>To come to the Sacrament in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and to eat it in diſtemper of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is <hi>not to eate the Lords Supper:</hi> that is, ſuch as ſo come do not ſo receive it in regard of the benefit and bleſſing, as if they received ſo holy an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as the Lords Supper: ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> The particle, <hi>Therefore,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the words to ſome thing before, to that Verſ. 18. <hi>When you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church, I here there be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions amongst you; when ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> therefore <hi>in one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> Therefore when men come together, and there be diviſions amongſt them, this is not to eate the Lords Supper; for ſuch perſons eat not the Lords Supper in regard of the benefits and bleſſings
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:260:118"/> that are received at the Lords Supper becauſe they eate not after the due order. <hi>This is not to eate the Lords Supper</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, for <hi>verſe</hi> 21. in eating every one takes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other his owne Supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken. So it may bee ſayd in this caſe, to come in malice to the Lords Table, <hi>this is not to eate the Lords Supper,</hi> which is a Supper of love, for how doe they eate the Lords Supper, when in eating, one mans heart ſwells againſt another, one man is ſicke with envy, another is filled with malice and hatred. <hi>They eate my people as they eate bread, Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Ye bite and devoure one another, Gal.</hi> 5. 15. Thinke wee when men eate up one another and devoure one another that they be fit to eate at the LORDS Table, or to eate the LORDS Body? or if they doe eate the Sacrament thinke wee that they doe eate the LORDS Supper? That they ſuppe with CHRIST and have any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:260:119"/> with him? It is a good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in one ſenſe to eate the Supper of the LORD in <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> with <hi>bitterneſſe of ſorrow</hi> for ſinne, but to come in <hi>bitterneſſe of ſpirit</hi> in regard of hatred and malice, this is that which will ſo imbitter the Ordinance unto us, that we ſhall have little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the action. The Sacrament is a ſeale, and in the right uſe of it the ſpirit ſeales up a mans redemption to him. Now he that would at any time be ſealed by the Spirit of God, eſpecially in the uſe of the ſeale of the Sacrament muſt take heede that hee grieve not the Spirit of GOD; <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. If we <hi>grieve</hi> him how ſhall we looke to have him <hi>ſeale</hi> us? Specially when we come to the Sacrament? I but what is it that <hi>grieves</hi> him ſo that he will not <hi>ſeale?</hi> Iudge by that which immediately followes, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:260:119"/> 
                  <hi>evill ſpeaking be put away from you with all malice.</hi> Therefore <hi>bitterneſſe, wrath, and malice, they grieve the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit of God.</hi> We looſe our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand when we come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and goe away <hi>unſealed;</hi> we goe away unſealed when we <hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit; we <hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit when we come to the Sacrament with a <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and an <hi>imbittered</hi> Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as at all times it is good counſell to put away <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> ſo it is eſpecially when men come to the Sacrament. There is a <hi>leaven of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> and the feaſt muſt not be kept with that leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. This muſt be <hi>purged out as old leaven.</hi> That ſame of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 14. 20. may ſerve for a rule for comming to the Sacrament; <hi>Brethren be not children in underſtanding, how bee it in malice bee yee children.</hi> How many come to the Sacrament as children in one ſenſe, and not as children in another? <hi>As children</hi> in an ill ſenſe, and not <hi>as children</hi> in a good ſenſe; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:260:120"/> as very children, to come thus like children is a dangerous thing. But to come <hi>as children</hi> in regard of <hi>malice,</hi> as free, as voyde of it as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thus to come like children is an happy thing. And as our Saviour ſpeakes in another caſe of receiving the Kingdome of GOD, ſo in this ſenſe it is true of receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdome of</hi> GOD <hi>as a little childe ſhall in no wiſe enter therein.</hi> So who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a little childe, in regard of freedome from malice, he ſhall reape no fruit by his receiving. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of charity in the generall, ſo I cloſe this point concerning charity in this particular to fit a man for the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, 3. <hi>Though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have no charity, I am nothing. And though I beſtow all my goods to feede the poore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have not charity</hi>

                  <hi>it profits mee nothing.</hi> So in this caſe, though thou often, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive theſe holy myſteries, and yet have not charity <hi>thou art nothing,</hi> and thy receiving is <hi>nothing.</hi> Though thou receiveſt the Sacrament every day in the weeke, and giveſt liberally at the Sacrament to the poore, and yet haſt not charity, <hi>it profits thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> So much wrong they doe themſelves that come not in due Order to the Sacrament, with that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> which GOD requires.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">CHAP. </seg>8</label> comes to no purpoſe. And how will it appeare that that man hath repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and truly turned from his <hi>ſin,</hi> who is not yet in the wayes of obedience. There is no man repents but he brings forth <hi>fruits worthy of repentance.</hi> The fruits of obedience are the fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming repentance. And how is there love without obedience, <hi>when love is the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13. 8. How can the Law bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled without obedience. So needfull is obedience to qualify a man for the Sacrament. A mans care muſt be to eate, and drinke worthily. He that will doe ſo, muſt have a care to doe that, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>To walke worthy of the Lord.</hi> He that is an <hi>unworthy walker</hi> can never be a <hi>worthy receiver.</hi> But how may a man walke worthily, or what is it to walke worthy of GOD? The Apoſtle teaches us what it is in the ſame place, <hi>That yee might walke worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitfull in every good worke.</hi> So
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:260:122"/> that to walke <hi>obediently</hi> is to walke <hi>worthily.</hi> And ſuch a <hi>worthy walking</hi> fits for a <hi>worthy receiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is that which GOD regards more then all outward performances, then the ſervices of his worſhip. It is a common error in many men to thinke that if they performe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties of worſhip they doe enough, and that theſe alone are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well pleaſing to God though no more be done. They thinke, ſo long as they pray, heare the Word, receive the Sacrament all is wondrous well, though they make no conſcience of obedience to Gods will otherwiſe; Though they obey not yet becauſe they doe duties of worſhip that they doe God very acceptable ſervice, whereas the truth is that when we give not God obedience, all ſervices have poore acceptance. Profeſſion of Religion, and godlineſſe a good thing it is, but yet a vaine thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obedience. <hi>Excellent ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a foole, Pro.</hi> 17. 7. And what
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:260:123"/> though <hi>Iſrael cry, my God wee knowe thee,</hi> what is this to the purpoſe ſo long as <hi>Iſrael hath caſt off the thing that is good, Hoſ.</hi> 8. 2, 3. Diſobedient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is abominable and a kinde of Athiſme denying GOD, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. And as profeſſion, ſo performances vaine. Their ſacrifices without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as acceptable as a <hi>Dogges head,</hi> or as <hi>Swines bloud, Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. Hearing without obedience as good as nothing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. no more then hearing a <hi>ſong,</hi> or a Muſician. GOD is highly well pleaſed with <hi>prayer,</hi> and yet he that <hi>prayes</hi> to God and yeelds him not obedience will finde poore ſpeede, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>He that turnes away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Yea the receiving of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to as little purpoſe as all the reſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25, 26. <hi>Circumciſion profits</hi> with obedience. <hi>Circumciſion is made uncircumciſion</hi> without obedience, and <hi>uncircumciſion</hi> with obedience preferred before <hi>circumciſion</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:260:123"/> 
                  <hi>Circumciſion profits if thou keepe the Law,</hi> ſo receiving the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion profits, and thou ſhalt finde benefit and good by it, if thou be one that walkeſt in obedience to GOD. <hi>But if thou be a breaker of the Law thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion.</hi> So if thou be not obedient to GOD and his Law thy receiving is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then not receiving. It is a good thing to come to the Sacrament, but it is a better thing to give God obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and it is the beſt of all, when firſt giving GOD obedience wee then come to receive the Sacrament. That which <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Saul</hi> is true in this caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Behold, to obey is better then ſacrifice.</hi> Sacrifice was a ſolemne ſervice. <hi>Saul</hi> thought ſacrifice was a goodly thing, and ſo it was when performed with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but he thought if God had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, it was no matter for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> teaches him another leſſon, that his obedience without a ſacrifice had beene better
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:260:124"/> then a ſacrifice without obedience. And ſo <hi>behold, to obey is better</hi> then to receive Sacraments. There were diverſe reaſons why obedience was better then ſacrifice. 1. Becauſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was more ſpiritual then ſacrifice. 2. <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was only at ſet, and ſolemne times, <hi>obedience</hi> was to be daily, hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. Sacrifice wicked men might and did offer, <hi>Cain</hi> ſacrificed as well as <hi>Abel;</hi> obedience onely could a good man performe, a wicked man obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not God. 4. Sacrifice was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if ſeparated from obedience, obedience ſeparated from, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without ſacrifice might be acceptable. 5. Obedience qualified, and fitted a man for ſacrifice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him to be an acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer. But ſacrifice fitted not a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient perſon unto obedience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to obey was better then to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Vpon the ſame grounds to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey is alſo better then to receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. It is a more ſpirituall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then bare receiving, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:260:124"/> and a more daily duty; it is duty which many doe not, cannot do, that yet receive the Sacraments: it may be accepted when the Sacrament is not received, not the receiving of the Sacrament accepted without it; and it is that which qualifies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a receiver for the Sacrament. And how needfull it is for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant to bee prepared thus, will appeare by theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, when we come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, we come to eat the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, wee come to eate Chriſt. It is but a folly to hope to eat Chriſt, when we yeeld not God obedience, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed, Iohn</hi> 6. But for whom is it meat and drink? For ſuch as when they come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are found ſuch as our Saviour was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 34. <hi>My meat is to doe the will of him that ſent me;</hi> Take, eat, <hi>this is my body:</hi> hee therefore offers his body to be eaten. But may any one eate it? Is it meate for all ſorts to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:260:125"/> eat? No, ſee who they are that eat and drinke, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Eat, O friends, yea, drinke abundantly, O beloved:</hi> He cals upon his <hi>friends,</hi> and his <hi>beloved,</hi> and cheeres them up to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink;</hi> we muſt then be his <hi>friends</hi> and his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> if we will <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drinke.</hi> And who then are his <hi>friends?</hi> who are his <hi>beloved?</hi> Such as yeeld him obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuch are his friends; <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you.</hi> Such are his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Hee that hath my Commandements, and keepes them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him;</hi> he ſhal be my beloved. Such are his beſt beloved friends, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſiſter, and mother, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 49, 50. Such friends ſhall be ſure to eat and drinke, and to drinke abundantly; &amp; obedience making us ſuch friends, makes us fit to eat and drinke at his Table. Looke how the Prophet ſpeakes of eating the good things of the Land; ſo it is in eating the good
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:260:125"/> things of the Sacrament, <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good things of the Land.</hi> There were good things in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> it was a Land flowing with milke and honey; they were <hi>good things.</hi> There were <hi>precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and precious things thruſt forth by the Moone, Deut.</hi> 33. 14. Now God promiſes them to make them partakers of theſe <hi>good things,</hi> that they ſhould eat of theſe <hi>precious</hi> fruits of the Land; but marke upon what condition, <hi>If ye be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent yee ſhall eate the good things of the Land.</hi> The caſe is the ſame here. In the Sacrament there be good things, there be precious things put forth by the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe, thruſt forth by the Spirit of God. Now theſe things are there to be eaten; <hi>take, eat, this is my body,</hi> but yet they are to be eaten with the ſame condition, If yee bee <hi>obedient,</hi> ye ſhall eat the <hi>good things</hi> of the Sacrament. If then wee come without obedience wee miſſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:260:126"/> eating the good things of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as good not eat the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as not eate the good things of it. Any man may eat the Sacrament, but only ſuch as be obedient, eat the good things of it: judge then how much it concernes to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament prepared with obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, when we come to the Sacrament, we come thither to have communion with Chriſt. They muſt firſt be obedient to Chriſt that will have communion with Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. There is a promiſe of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Chriſt will have with us, and that we ſhall have with him, <hi>I will come in to him and will ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> we will have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communion together. But yet marke upon what termes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is promiſed, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knock,</hi> if any man will open <hi>unto mee, I will come in, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt Hee knocks at the doore of mens hearts, by the gratious motions of his Spirit; by the miniſtery of his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:260:126"/> word he cals for this and for that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: now when wee yeeld obedience to his voice and cals, then <hi>we open the doore,</hi> and when the doore is opened he enters, and there followes mutuall fellowſhip betweene him and us: if the doore be kept barred and bolted, then neither <hi>entrance,</hi> nor <hi>ſupper;</hi> but when the doore is unlockt and ſet open, then he enters, and the mutuall Supper followes. To teach us, that then Chriſt will have communion with us when we are obedient to his voice; but no obedience to him, no communion with him; even from the Lords Supper wil he ſend them away ſupperleſſe, that have not opened to him and yeelded obedience before their comming to the Table. There is a promiſe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will come unto us, that <hi>he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe unto us:</hi> now Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes good this promiſe more than in the uſe of the Sacrament; there he comes to a man, and there he manifeſts and makes knowne himſelfe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:260:127"/> to a man, that looke as it is ſaid in that caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 30, 31. <hi>That as he ſate at meat with them, and took bread and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and brake, and gave them, their eyes were opened and they knew him,</hi> and Verſ. 35. <hi>He was knowne of them in breaking of bread;</hi> ſo it is in this caſe in the breaking and giving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, the faithfull have their <hi>eyes opened,</hi> and they <hi>know him,</hi> he is made <hi>knowne</hi> to them in breaking of Sacramentall bread; in the uſe of the Supper he ſpecially manifeſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them. But now obſerve the condition on which Chriſt makes this promiſe, Verſe 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandements and keepes them, he it is that loves mee, and hee that loveth mee ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and I will manifeſt my ſelfe to him:</hi> and ſo Verſ. 23. <hi>If any man love me, hee will keepe my words, and my Father will love him, and wee will come unto him and make our abode with him:</hi> ſo that both theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes run with the condition of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:260:127"/> upon a mans obedience will Chriſt <hi>come,</hi> upon a mans obedience will he manifeſt himſelfe to him. As good not come to the Sacrament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Chriſt alſo <hi>come</hi> in it to a man: as good never come, unleſſe Chriſt <hi>manifeſt</hi> himſelfe to him. If then we would have Chriſt <hi>come</hi> and <hi>manifeſt</hi> himſelfe to us in the Sacrament, ſo muſt it be our care to come with, and to manifeſt our obedience. A man may aske that queſtion that <hi>Iudas</hi> doth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Lord how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelfe unto us, and not unto the world?</hi> So, how is it that Chriſts manifeſts himſelfe to ſome in the Sacrament, and not to other ſome? To which the ſame anſwer in effect may be given that there Chriſt gives; becauſe ſome are obedient to God, they love him and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; therefore hee ſhewes himſelfe to them in the Sacrament, and they therein have communion with him, but others live not, walke not in obedience: therefore he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:260:128"/> comes to them when they come to the Sacrament, nor ſhewes or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts himſelfe to them, they goe as they come.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14. ſpeakes of the communion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, The communion of the Holy Ghoſt bee with you all.</hi> That which he wiſhes them ſhould be the thing we ſhould eſpecially aime at in comming to the Communion, namely, <hi>that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghost ſhould be with us.</hi> And it is a cleere caſe that the Holy Ghoſt is to be received in the Sacraments, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:260:129"/> things then we ſee, how needfull it is for a Communicant to be prepared with obedience. And by this alſo we ſee how many deceive themſelves in their comming to the Sacrament, who minde nothing leſſe than an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient walking in a godly courſe to fit them for the Sacrament. How many that give no regard at all to <hi>Gods</hi> word, that indeed ſlight it, and obedience to it, and yet would ſeeme to make an high account of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?

               <p>THus we ſee how a Communicant is habitually prepared, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his habituall preparation ſtands. It followes now to ſpeake of that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preparation, which is required in every one that would bee a worthy and a welcome gueſt at the <hi>Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and would come after that due Order that is required: for though a man have all theſe forenamed quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, yet he muſt not here ſet up his reſt: but there is yet a further worke to be done, as wee partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaw in the fourth Chapter. This actuall preparation ſtands in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelfe in ſpeciall manner for that worke, and ſervice of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by doing thoſe things, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch duties, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:260:130"/> not onely for a good Chriſtian, but for a good and profitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant. Knowledge, Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Charity, and Obedience, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every one that will bee a good Chriſtian. A good Chriſtian a man muſt be before he can be a good Communicant: but yet a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not enough in the generall, there muſt be ſomething in ſpeciall done in reference to this duty. Indeed ſome Papiſts thinke that <hi>actuall devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not neceſſary to the receiving of the Sacrament; becauſe as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was of ancient given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo now it may be given to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and frantick perſons who have no actuall devotion at all. But it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that this conceit is diſallowed of their owne men: for to give perſons without actuall devotion no more right to the Sacrament then to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and mad-men, is to give them no right at all. There is no queſtion but they may come as orderly to the Sacrament, as children and mad-men
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:260:131"/> may doe. But whoſoever it is that will come orderly, muſt have actuall devotion, and actuall preparation, yea, though he be already habitually prepared. The five wiſe Virgins took oile in their Veſſels with their lamps, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 4. and their lampes were burning, but yet when they heare the Bridegroome was comming they preſently <hi>ariſe and trim their lampes,</hi> and ſo prepare to goe and meet him. They prepared to meet him when they tooke their lampes, and when they lighted them, and when they tooke oile in their veſſels: all this was preparation to meet the <hi>Bridegroome;</hi> but when they heare the Bridegroom was comming, then they fall to a freſh preparation, <hi>in trimming their lampes</hi> to make them burne brighter and cleerer. So it is in this caſe; habituall preparation is like the taking and lighting the lampes, and carrying oile in the veſſels: actuall preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like the freſh trimming of them when they burnt dimly. The get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:260:131"/> of knowledge, faith, repentance, love, and obedience, this is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and the lighting of the lampes, and taking oile in the Veſſels, but the renewing, exciting of theſe, and the doing of other things in actuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is the trimming of the lampes. A Muſitian hath skill and cunning on his inſtrument, but yet if his Inſtrument be out of tune, and his hands cold, and his fingers num; he will firſt tune his Inſtrument, and warme and rub his hands and fingers to make them active and nimble, to play on his Inſtrument. An Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer hath the skill of his trade, and knowes the myſtery of it thorowly well; but yet when he goes to build a houſe, or doe ſome ſuch worke, hee firſt grindes, whets, and ſharpens his tooles. If a Muſitian ſhall play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an untuned Inſtrument, or with his benummed fingers, he will make but harſh and unpleaſing muſick. If the Carpenter though ever ſo expert in his faculty, ſhall worke with blunt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:260:132"/> and gapt tooles, hee will make but bungling and clouterly worke of it. And though a man may have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, &amp;c. yet if he reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that habituall preparation, and doe not beſides actually prepare and fit himſelfe, hee is like to meet with little comfort and content in the duty, in regard of the cold and dead manner of performance: he will but fumble and bungle in the worke. So that beſides this habituall there is an actuall preparation neceſſary. Now this actual preparation ſtands in theſe things:</p>

               <p n="1">1 For the firſt. In this <hi>actuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> there muſt be an <hi>abſtraction</hi> and a ſolemne <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> of the ſoul from all other avocations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. There may be, and muſt bee ſome fitting of a mans ſelfe for the duty, from the time that a man hath notice of the Sacrament to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtred; but now on the day before, when the time of receiving approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a man ſhould at leaſt towards the end of the foregoing day <hi>ſeparate</hi> himſelfe from all other thoughts and occaſions, &amp; mind wholly the worke of preparation to the Sacrament. And this ſequeſtration of a mans ſelfe ſtands in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In <hi>ſetting aſide all lawfull thoughts, occaſions, and buſineſſes of our callings.</hi> Set by all ſuch cares and thoughts, and wholly ſuſpend them. Doe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did when he went to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>Iſaac</hi> at Mount <hi>Moriah, Gen.</hi> 22. 4, 5. <hi>When he ſaw the place afar off, he ſaid unto them abide you here with the</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:260:133"/> 
                  <hi>Aſſe, and I and the Lad will goe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> It was wiſely and well done of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He ſaw and knew that if they had gone with him they would have diſtracted him, they would have bin troubleſome to him, and have hindred him in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they would have cried out, and have made ſuch clamours, that with no quietneſſe and freedome of ſpirit he could have done the ſervice. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſaw the place <hi>a farre off,</hi> he bids them ſtay behinde, it was a preparation <hi>afarre off,</hi> when he ſaw the <hi>place afarre off.</hi> The like ſhould our care be when we ſee the <hi>time afar off,</hi> but ſpecially when wee ſee the time neere and at hand, the Even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee ſhould then ſet aſide all our thoughts and buſineſſes, and bid them wholly ſtand aſide, and not ſuffer them, not onely not to goe to the Mount with us, but not to goe into our cloſets, and ſecret chamber with us. It may bee ſuch a buſineſſe will bee calling upon thee to attend, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:260:133"/> thinke upon it, It is a matter of ſome conſequence and concernment, it is not good to ſlight it. It may bee there is ſuch an occaſion of weight that cals upon thee to be remembred; but in ſuch a caſe ſay to all ſecular occaſions, and avocations as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> did to <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Geſhem</hi> when they ſent to him, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let us meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſome of the Villages, &amp;c.</hi> But marke how hee anſwers them, Verſ. 3. <hi>And I ſent meſſengers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſaying, I am doing a great worke ſo that I cannot come downe; why ſhould the worke ceaſe whileſt I leave it and come downe to you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though theſe fellowes had ſo round and reſolute an anſwer, yet they were importuning him ſtill, Verſe 4. <hi>Yet they ſent unto mee foure times after this ſort,</hi> and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they ſent, ſo often hee gave them that anſwer, <hi>And I anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the ſame manner.</hi> So when a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:260:134"/> man begins to ſequeſter himſelfe, and to ſet himſelfe apart for his actuall preparation, this and the other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wil be calling upon a man, come let us think upon this thing, and let us conſider that; but then ſhould a man anſwer, I am doing <hi>a great worke,</hi> I am preparing my ſelfe for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I cannot attend upon you, why ſhould the work of preparation ceaſe whileſt I leave it and attend upon you? And though they haunt and importune thee, even unto four times after this ſort, yet ſtill anſwer them after the ſame manner. We finde in their faſts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 3. the phraſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating themſelves, <hi>ſhould I weepe ſeparating my ſelfe.</hi> Now as in faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo in our preparation to this holy Feaſt, there ſhould be a ſeparating of a mans ſelfe. And this is a maine part of this ſeparation, when a man ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates himſelfe from all his ſecular thoughts and buſineſſes, and ſets them wholly aſide to fit himſelfe the better for this worke. It muſt be here as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:260:134"/> in the caſe of prayer, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. 6. <hi>When thou prayeſt enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy doore, pray, &amp;c.</hi> I know our Saviour meanes it in another ſenſe, that in regard of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and ſecrecy, a man ſhould <hi>ſhut his doore</hi> when he prayes; but yet alſo in another ſenſe ſhould a man firſt ſhut his doore, and then pray, that is, ſhut his doore againſt all ſuch thoughts, as may diſtract him in the duty, he ſhould ſhut out of doores all diſtracting thoughts, and cauſe them to ſtand without doores that he may doe the duty with the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And ſo in this duty of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy doore</hi> prepare thy ſelfe; when thou haſt ſhut out of doores all ſecular cares and thoughts of other buſineſſe, ſet upon the work of preparation.</p>
               <p>In receiving the Sacrament there is a ſervice to be done to God. Now we muſt ſerve God in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a ſervant doth his maſter.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:260:135"/> See how our Saviour ſpeakes of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to doe his maſter ſervice, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 8. <hi>Girde thy ſelfe, and ſerve mee.</hi> It was the faſhion in thoſe Eaſterne parts, for men to go in long garments downe to their feete. And therefore when men were to goe about any worke, they uſed to gird, and tuck up their garments that they might not trouble them in their worke, by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſe about their heeles. So it muſt be with us when we goe about any ſervice to GOD; we muſt firſt <hi>gird up</hi> our ſelves, and then <hi>ſerve</hi> him. A looſe, diſcinct, and a diffluent mind is not fit to doe God any ſervice. Therfore we are called upon to <hi>gird up our loynes, Luke</hi> 12. 35. <hi>Let your loines be girded about,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the loines of your mindes.</hi> Two things are required in a good ſervant. 1. <hi>Readineſſe,</hi> and <hi>preparedneſſe</hi> to do his maſters commands ſo ſoone as he calls. 2. <hi>Nimbleneſſe, handineſſe,</hi> and handſomeneſſe in doing what he is enjoyned. Now this <hi>girding</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:260:135"/> both. 1. A prepared readineſſe before hand to doe his maſters will. A ſervant that is girded and hath his garments truſt up about him, let his maſter bid him doe ſuch a ſervice, he is ready, and prepared to doe it ſo ſoone as he ſpeaks, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 35. 36. <hi>Let your loynes be girded, and ye your ſelves like men that waite for their Lord, that when he comes and knockes they may open unto him immediately.</hi> Let a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be ungirt, and he is not ſo ready to doe what his maſter commands, becauſe firſt he muſt have a time to gird himſelfe, and his maſters worke muſt ſtay till he be girded, and he muſt be <hi>girding,</hi> when he ſhould be <hi>working.</hi> 2. It implies dexterity, and handſomeneſſe in his worke. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt ſervant if he ſerved his maſter and did his worke enjoyned, yet he could not doe it cleaverly, becauſe his garment hanging looſe about him would ſo puzzle, and cumber him: an ungirt ſervant would be but a fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling puzzle in his worke. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:260:136"/> the maſter bids his ſervant firſt <hi>gird</hi> himſelfe, and then <hi>ſerve</hi> him. It is juſt ſo in all Gods ſervices, and ſo in this ſervice of receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God requires a <hi>preparedneſſe</hi> to, and an <hi>handineſſe</hi> in the worke. And therefore this girding up of our loines is exceeding neceſſary before our comming to the Sacrament. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe God lookes that when we come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> we ſhould be ready to doe the worke he there requires. If the loines of our mindes be ungirt, and we come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with looſe ſpirits, diſtracted with a company of earthly cares, we ſhall be unready to doe the worke of receiving CHRIST which he there commandes. He will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us there to take, and receive CHRIST. Now if we come with looſe hearts, and mindes, we muſt make God ſtay our leaſure before we can doe it; we muſt firſt have ſome time to <hi>gird up our loynes,</hi> and to tucke up this tatter, and that ragge, and the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:260:136"/> other danglement that hangs about our heeles, before we can take, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive CHRIST. And ſo we muſt be <hi>girding,</hi> and <hi>tucking</hi> when wee ſhould be <hi>receiving. Secondly,</hi> becauſe if we come with ungirt loines, with looſe ſpirits, and doe Gods worke ſo, we ſhall doe it puzlingly, and fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly. Our long garments hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſe about our ſides and heeles, we ſhall make but poore worke of it. If a maſter had commanded a Iewiſh ſervant with his loines ungirt to have gone to plow, or to have digged in his vineyard, how awkely would he have done theſe workes? He could not have followed his Plough but he would ever, and anon have been tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his looſe garment, and have beene ready to have fallen upon his face, he could not have ſet his foote upon his ſpade, but he would have beene treading upon the looſe skirt of his garment which would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hindred, and troubled him in his worke, he could not have been
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:260:137"/> expedite in his buſineſſe, ſo long as his garments hang about his feet. It wil be no better with us comming to the Sacrament with ungirt hearts, and mindes, our looſe thoughts will be ſo troubleſome that it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us ever to make good worke of it. And therefore looke how God would have that firſt Paſſeover eaten, ſo muſt it be in eating the Sacrament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>And thus ſhall yee eate it,</hi> that is, after this order, <hi>with your loines girded.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> ſhall you eat the Lords Supper, with your <hi>loines girded.</hi> And this is one maine part of <hi>girding our loines,</hi> the ſetting aſide, &amp; putting by al our ſecular thoughts, and imployments.</p>
               <p>We ſhall finde two caſes that made a man unfit for eating the Paſſeover. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 10, 13. <hi>Vncleanneſſe</hi> by a dead body, and being in <hi>journey</hi> a far off. If a man had touched a <hi>dead body</hi> it made him <hi>uncleane,</hi> and ſo unfit for the Paſſeover. It was not fit an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſon ſhould meddle with ſo
<pb facs="tcp:260:137"/> holy an Ordinance. But obſerve, that not onely a man uncleane by a dead body was unfit for the Paſſover, but a man that was in a <hi>journie a farre off.</hi> Why was ſuch a man unfit? Like enough being in a journey his minde, and thoughts would be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the buſineſſe of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or being in a journey a farre off, his minde would be ſo upon home, and he would be ſo taken up with ſuch cares, and feares as uſually men are filled withall when they are farre from home, that he by reaſon of thoſe thoughts, and diſtractions would be utterly unfit for the Paſſeover. Many are in the minde that if they be free from a <hi>dead body,</hi> that if they have not defiled themſelves with ſome groſſe ſinne, of drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe and the like, that they are very fit for the Sacrament, but in the meane time come to the Sacrament whileſt they are in their <hi>journies,</hi> with hearts undiſcharged of earthly buſineſſe, and cares, and having their hearts in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:260:138"/> journies, travelling up and downe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one worldly buſineſſe or other, even when they are at the LORDS Table. Therefore let men take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that a <hi>journey</hi> may unfit for the Lords Table, as well as a <hi>dead body.</hi> That he is unfit to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hath a company of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, and thoughts peſtering his minde, as well as he that hath defiled himſelfe with ſome groſſe <hi>ſinne.</hi> It is lamentable to conſider how many men bring their ſervants, and <hi>the Aſſe,</hi> even to the very <hi>mount,</hi> how many are called away from the Lords <hi>worke</hi> to meete with their <hi>Sanballats,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhems,</hi> how many are in their <hi>journies</hi> when they are comming, and when they are come to the Sacrament. When our Saviour CHRIST overtook the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> he asked them this queſtion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 17. <hi>What manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications are theſe that ye have one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as ye walke?</hi> So let one but aske men, What manner of thoughts are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:260:138"/> they that you have in your hearts over night before the Sacrament? What manner of conferences, and communications be they that they have one with another, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nay the very morning as they walk together to the publique aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to receive the Sacrament? How happy were it that they could anſwer as the two Diſciples did there, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Concerning Ieſus of Nazareth,</hi> concerning the benefits and the ends of the Sacrament, and the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required to it. But it is nothing ſo. If their communications, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences be not vaine, fooliſh and froathy, yet at the beſt they are but mercate communications, conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about Sheep, Oxen, about the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of graine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with theſe conferences come they to the very <hi>Church</hi> doores when they come to receive the Sacrament. Is not this worſe then to have received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Paſſeover a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>journey?</hi> Is not this a pitifull

When men come to the Sacrament piping hot out of the world, out of their worldly conferences, and from their worldly thoughts, and have not ſome convenient time before diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and disburdened their hearts of them, muſt not that frame of heart, and bent of ſpirit needs come along with them to the Lords Table? And muſt they not needs be <hi>tumultuous</hi> and troubleſome? Muſt they not needs make ſuch a noyſe and ſuch a dinne as muſt cauſe diſtraction in this holy ſervice? And how can ſuch a frame of ſpirit agree with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 35. <hi>That you may attend upon the Lord without diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Which is a rule as well for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, as for all other ſervices of God.

It muſt be with a godly man at the Sacrament as it is ſayd to have beene in the Temple. There was abundance of fleſh ſacrificed in the Temple, and yet they ſay there was never any flye ſeene in the Temple. So ſhould it be with us at the Sacrament, not a fly to be ſeene, or heard buzzing there.

               <p n="1">1 This is an undoubted and a ſure truth, that a mans comfort depends as well upon <hi>his knowledge</hi> of his fitneſſe, as upon <hi>his fitneſſe</hi> it ſelfe. It is not enough to be fit and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but a man muſt know it. So long as the conſcience queſtions a mans fitneſſe, and is in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man be fit or no, though hee bee fit and well prepared, yet the doubts of the conſcience, and the feares it is in, will not only allay, but quite foreſtall all the comforts that would ariſe from his fitneſſe. To a mans comfortable receiving, it is as needfull to <hi>know</hi> his fitneſſe, as to have it. There is no grace or good thing that a Chriſtian hath, but it may be knowne to him that he hath it. What is a rich man better than a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:260:144"/> poore man, if he be not privie to his wealth, if he have treaſure and know it not? Wherein are his wants, feares, cares, diſtractions, and diſquiets of ſpirit leſſe than a poore mans? It was <hi>Laodiceas</hi> ill condition, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and knoweſt not that thou art poore.</hi> And it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans condition, He ſaith <hi>I am poore,</hi> and knowes not that <hi>he is rich.</hi> This is the ſafer condition indeed of the two, but yet for the preſent, it is but a drooping and uncheerefull eſtate. Therefore as our <hi>ſafety</hi> lyes in <hi>having</hi> Chriſt and his graces, ſo our comfort lyes in <hi>knowing</hi> that we have them. And know our wealth wee may. A Chriſtian not onely knowes God, but hee knowes that hee knowes him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 3. <hi>And hereby wee know that we know him.</hi> A Chriſtian not onely is in God, but he may know that he is in God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Hereby know wee that wee are in him.</hi> And 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him.</hi> A Chriſtian
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:260:145"/> may know that he beleeves, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">CHAP. </seg>10</label> 5. 10. <hi>He that beleeves on the Sonne of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelfe.</hi> A Chriſtian may know that God loves him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 16. <hi>And we have knowne and beleeved the love that God hath to us.</hi> A Chriſtian may know that he loves Gods children, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 1. <hi>By this we know that we love the children of God.</hi> A Chriſtian may know that he is of the truth, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 19. <hi>And hereby we know that wee are of the truth.</hi> A Chriſtian may know that God abides in him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 24. <hi>And hereby we know that hee abides in us.</hi> A Chriſtian may know that he hath eternall life, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>That ye may know that ye have eternall life.</hi> But now how comes a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to know all theſe things? The way by which a man gets the knowledge of all theſe things, is the <hi>examination of himſelfe.</hi> A man firſt tries and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines himſelfe in all theſe, and by examination comes to the knowledge of them, and from the <hi>knowledge</hi> of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:260:145"/> them ariſes his <hi>comfort</hi> in them. So it is in the caſe of fitneſſe for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is abundance of comfort the heart hath in the knowledge of its owne fitneſſe; and this knowledge ariſes from the examination of a mans ſelfe. A man that examines not himſelfe, for ought he knowes, may come an unworthy gueſt, hee knowes not whether he be worthy or no; but this he knowes, that hee that is unworthy is unwelcome, and ſo cannot come but with a tremulous and an heſitant heart, fearing leſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a bleſſing he may meet with a breach. It is impoſſible in ſuch a caſe that a man ſhould receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. I dare not ſay of eating the Sacrament, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in the caſe of eating ſome meates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And he that doubts is damned if he eat;</hi> a man may come with <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>feares</hi> to the Sacrament, and come acceptably: but this I may ſay, That he that doubts of the lawfulneſſe of his comming, he exceedingly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:260:146"/> his owne comfort if hee eate doubtingly, doubting whether he be fit to eat, doubting whether he may come, yea, or no; eating with ſuch doubtings muſt needs be prejudiciall to a mans comfortable eating. Now the way to prevent ſuch doubtings, is to live by that rule the Apoſtle gives in that caſe of eating, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>Let every man bee fully perſwaded in his owne minde.</hi> Be carefull beforehand to take ſuch a courſe, as may aſſoile and cleere up ſuch doubts: take ſuch a courſe as may aſſure, and perſwade your hearts, that you are fit in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable meaſure to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But what courſe may be taken to this purpoſe? <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelfe.</hi> The way to put all out of doubt, and to prevent ſuch troubleſome doubtings when we are come, is <hi>ſelfe examination.</hi> For when a man hath ſeriouſly examined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee ſhall thereby bee inabled to give a true judgement of his own fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and an examined heart, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:260:146"/> examination hath found it ſelfe fit, is able to charme all troubleſome doubts, and can ſay to them, Be ſtil, &amp; trouble me not, for I have throughly examined my ſelfe, and upon ſerious and ſincere examination, I know that I am a fit and a worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. Doubts, they trouble the heart, examination prevents doubts, and ſettles the heart, and puts things out of doubt. When Chriſt after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection appeared to his Diſciples; they were terrified and affrighted, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 37. but ſee how Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers them, Verſ. 38. <hi>Why are yee troubled, and why do doubts,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ariſe in your hearts.</hi> They ſhould with all gladneſſe have received and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſt, but contrarily, they were troubled. And whence came the trouble of their ſpirits? <hi>Why doe doubts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> Mark then, that doubts trouble the heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it for the receiving of Chriſt. They doubted whether hee were Chriſt or not, and were ſo troubled
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:260:147"/> with theſe doubts, that as yet they received him not. But afterwards their doubts are turned into joy, V. 41. They rejoyce at the ſight and preſence of Chriſt, but how came theſe doubts to be removed, and to be changed into joy? <hi>Chriſt</hi> puts them to the examination and triall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Verſ. 39. to put them out of doubt, <hi>Behold my hands, and my feet, that it is I my ſelfe; and when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his hands and his feet.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I ſee you are much troubled with doubtings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be Chriſt, or not; <hi>examine</hi> and try me, view me, feele me, handle me, and you ſhal find by examination, that I am not as you think, a ſpirit. And ſo in <hi>probability</hi> they examining him w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their eyes, and with their hands found him to be no ſpirit; found him to bee Chriſt, and had their doubts remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and joyfully received him for Chriſt indeed. Thus, as this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion removed &amp; cleered their doubts that troubled them; ſo examination of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:260:147"/> our ſelves would prevent the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are ready to trouble us in receiving the Sacrament. If we would behold and ſee, if we would look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, and feele and handle our owne hearts, yea, ſearch and dive into them by examination, how ſhould we prevent our troubleſome doubtings, and how ſhould we meet with joy &amp; comfort inſtead of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? We come to Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; In one ſenſe, in regard of that awfull reſpect wee ſhould have unto his bleſſed Majeſty, we ſhould come to Chriſt as that woman did, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 33. <hi>The woman fearing and trembling, came and fell downe before him:</hi> but in another ſenſe, namely when it riſes from an ignorance of our own eſtate, whether we be fit to come to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, or not, and from the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>conſcience,</hi> that we are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as we ſhould be; thus to come with feare and trembling is not good: examination would prevent feare. By examination we ſhould finde out the truth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:260:148"/> of our condition, we ſhould finde out whether we be fit or not. And upon examination finding our ſelves fit, we ſhould come with an holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and confidence of ſpirit, to Chriſt in his Ordinance. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire to have our hearts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of troubles, and doubts, when wee are drawing neere to the Lords Table; as we would not have conſcience peſter us with diſquieting ſcruples, and unſeaſonable diſputes, &amp; reaſonings whether we may come or no; ſo beforehand beſtow ſome time and paines in a private ſcrutiny, and ſearch of our ſelves: examination wil prevent all theſe, and we ſhall be able to huſh and ſtill them all, if wee can ſay, I have examined mine heart, I have ſincerely tried my ſelfe, and I find upon good examination, that I have good leave to come to the <hi>Lords</hi> Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is better a great deale to examine our ſelves before we come, then to be <hi>examined by God.</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:260:148"/> 
                  <hi>God</hi> wil examine ſuch to the purpoſe, that wil not be at the pains &amp; trouble to examine themſelves. It was a ſharp kinde of examination by which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have beene examined, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 24. The chiefe Captaine commanded <hi>that he ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſcourging.</hi> Certainly, when men neglect ſelfe-examination, God will himſelfe examine them, but it will be an <hi>examination with ſcourging.</hi> Every interrogatory and queſtion that God puts to us, ſhall be as a ſmarting laſh with a ſcourge, yea, as a ſtinging laſh with a Scorpion. The man that came to the Feaſt without his wedding garment, never <hi>examined himſelfe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came, whether he had a nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall garment to goe in or not; God therefore <hi>examines</hi> him, but it is with a ſcourging queſtion that made his heart ſmart, <hi>Friend, how carneſt thou in hither, not having a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> It was a <hi>ſcourging queſtion,</hi> that drew bloud on his conſcience. When a man comes to the Sacrament, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:260:149"/> hath not examined himſelfe, and <hi>God</hi> comes to him, and ſayes, as to <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>What doeſt thou here Eliah?</hi> So, what doeſt thou here at my Table? How will ſuch a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pinch the conſcience, what a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding laſh will it be to a mans heart? Thoſe are laſhing interrogatories, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands, to tread in my Courts? Iſay</hi> 58. 5. <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt that I have choſen? Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. <hi>What haſt thou to doe, that thou ſhouldeſt take my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in thy mouth? Ier.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>Will yee steale, murder, and commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, &amp;c. and come and ſtand before me in this houſe?</hi> Theſe be <hi>ſcourging examinations,</hi> that fetch bloud at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtroake: with ſuch kind of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuch kind of interrogatories, will <hi>God</hi> examine men that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf-examined to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Now when God ſhall come to ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, <hi>who may abide the day of his comming?</hi> and <hi>who ſhall stand when he appeares?</hi> as <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks in another
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:260:149"/> caſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. How terrible a thing will it be to be thus examined: were it not good for every one to take a courſe to prevent ſo ſharpe an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? There is a way to doe it, and that is, before wee come to the Sacrament, let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for as the Apoſtle ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged,</hi> namely, of the Lord: ſo if we would examine our ſelves, we ſhould not be examined of the Lord. But if we examine not our ſelves, then ſhal we be both <hi>examined</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> When a man hath examined himſelf, he needs not feare Gods examination; nay, a man may then be willing to come under <hi>Gods examination. David</hi> puts himſelf upon Gods examination, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139. 23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know mine heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there bee any wicked way in me.</hi> Certainly, <hi>David</hi> never durſt have beene ſo bold, as to have put himſelfe upon Gods examination, if
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:260:150"/> he had not firſt examined himſelfe. But having firſt examined himſelfe, and thereupon knowing his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience throughly well, now he dares be tried by God himſelfe. Oh, with what ſweet confidence might we put our ſelves upon Gods owne triall when we come to the Sacrament, if we our ſelves had had our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on triall firſt? But how dreadfull will Gods examination be to ſuch, who neither uſe, nor liſt, nor care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to the Sacrament, to examine themſelves?</p>

               <p>The <hi>graces</hi> that muſt bee tried and examined, muſt bee ſpecially thoſe before named, required to bee habitually in a Communicant, <hi>Faith, Repentance, Love, and Obedience.</hi> The <hi>truth, growth,</hi> and <hi>wants</hi> of them, all muſt bee examined. A man ſhould examine grace as he doth gold. Gold may be counterfeit, may ſhew faire, and yet be baſe mettall; in ſuch a caſe, a man examines it by the <hi>Touchſtone,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:260:151"/> and bringeth it to the <hi>Test:</hi> gold may <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">CHAP. </seg>11</label> be true and good, but may faile in the <hi>weight;</hi> it may be good gold, but too light: in ſuch a caſe, a man brings it to the ſcales, and to the <hi>weight,</hi> and ſo either weight or want is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So muſt grace bee examined. There is a great deale of counterfeit grace in the world. All is not gold that gliſters; and all is not grace that makes a ſhew. There is a great deale of copper grace, copper faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c. in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What did <hi>Moſes</hi> for a time, but the Aegyptian Sorcerers did the ſame? <hi>Moſes</hi> turnes the <hi>waters into bloud,</hi> ſo doe they, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Moſes</hi> brings <hi>Frogs upon the Land,</hi> ſo doe they, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 6. 7. And their bloud and Frogs ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as true bloud and Frogs, as thoſe brought by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thoſe things they did, ſeemed as great miracles as what <hi>Moſes</hi> did; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought realities, all theirs were but juglings and ſorceries. There is nothing that a true Chriſtian can have, or doe,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:260:151"/> but an hypocrite may have and doe, for the outward ſemblance as much as he. Therefore ſince a mans gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be counterfeit, they muſt be brought to the <hi>touchſtone,</hi> and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined there for their truth. Againe, there is much true grace, that is grace indeed, faith, and repentance indeed, which yet have not that growth, that their time and meanes they have beene under requires, and ſo want of their <hi>weight.</hi> How often doth CHRIST rebuke his Diſciples with this, <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch a caſe, a man muſt bring his graces to bee examined by the ballance of the Sanctuary, which may make knowne to every man, what is the <hi>weight,</hi> and what is the <hi>want</hi> of his graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt then try and examine the truth of Grace, whether theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be truly in us, or no.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:260:152"/>
               <p> The firſt grace to be tryed is the <hi>grace of faith.</hi> That which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts Chriſtians upon at all times is ſpecially of uſe before the Sacrament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith, prove your owne ſelves.</hi> The Corinthians were very buſie about examining S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and his miniſtery, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>Since ye ſeeke a proofe of</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in me,</hi> and ſo we are very ready to be buſie in the examination of other men, and their faith, but ſayes Saint <hi>Paul, examine your ſelves:</hi> ſo it is good for us at all times, but ſpecially before the Sacrament, to examine our owne faith. As <hi>Philip,</hi> before he adminiſtred the Sacrament of baptiſme to the <hi>Eunuch, Acts</hi> 8. 37. did examine him of his faith: ſo ſhould every man before the receiving of the Sacrament of the Supper examine himſelfe of his faith. Theſe reaſons that pinch us to examination of our faith at all times, have ſtrength in them to doe it ſpecially at this time. as,</p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:260:152"/>
               <p> Firſt without this tryall, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination a man may be cheated, gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and coſened in the poynt of faith. It is good therefore to try before we truſt, <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 3. <hi>The eare tryes words as the mouth tastes meate.</hi> To the <hi>eye</hi> many meates ſeeme pleaſant, and dainty, but the <hi>mouth</hi> taſting them knowes juſtly what they be. So the eare heares words. We ſhould get a good ſpirituall eare, that we may be able judiciouſly to diſcerne the faire, and flattering words of Satan, and our owne hearts. Theſe will give a man as good words as may be. Doe not, ſay they, diſquiet thine heart with needleſſe feares, cheere up thine heart man, thou needeſt not queſtion the truth of thy faith, Theſe are good words. But now, as the <hi>mouth taſtes meate,</hi> and by taſting takes a tryall of it, ſo muſt we labour to have ſuch an <hi>eare</hi> as may <hi>try theſe words</hi> whether they be true or not. A good muſitian had neede to have a good eare, and a good Chriſtian hath neede of a good
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:260:153"/> care too, by which he may be able to judge of the falſe, and flattering mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke the Divell, and his owne heart make him. <hi>Try the ſpirits,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. As forreyne ſpirits without, ſo it is good to try the ſecret ſpirits within us. For there be two ſpirits, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and the ſpirit of Satan; and Satans ſpirit doth often counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the voice of Gods Spirit, and tels us that we have faith, excellent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of faith, when there is no ſuch matter: therefore try the ſpirits. That was a vile thing in the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. after <hi>Herods</hi> Oration, to cry out, <hi>The voice of God.</hi> It is much more vile in us, when Satan and our owne heart ſhall flatter us, with falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of faith, to cry out, <hi>The voice of God,</hi> and the <hi>voice of the Spirit.</hi> Try therefore before you truſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is a very hopefull and comfortable evidence of the truth of faith, when it is willing to be tried, and deſirous to be examined. It is a ſuſpicion that that mans gold is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:260:153"/> not good, that is unwilling to have it toucht; that a mans cauſe is naught, when he is unwilling to have it tried; that a man is no Scholler, that ſhuns examination. It is a ſigne that a mans gold is good, that is willing and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have it brought to the touch. A good cauſe deſires a faire triall. A good Scholler that hath it in him, is willing to undergoe examination, which a dunce and a non-proficient hath no liking to. A faith that is a true faith, will be willing to undergoe any triall and examination.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the triall and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of faith, is the ſtrengthning and increaſing of it. Faith examined and tried, proves a faith increaſed and ſtrengthned. Some things ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove the worſe, and ſuffer loſſe by triall; but the more faith is tried, the more faith is increaſed. Gold is not the worſe, but the better, the purer for triall. As the <hi>fiery triall</hi> of faith betters it, and makes it the <hi>more pretious, and makes it to be found</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:260:154"/> 
                  <hi>unto praiſe, and honour and glory, at the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. So doth ſelfe-triall make it <hi>more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and <hi>more glorious.</hi> Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and triall of a good Scholler hurts him not, either in his learning or his credit; nay, it advances him much in both: his very examination rubs up his learning, it brings much to minde that would have been forgotten, yea, it puts much learning into a Scholler: and beſides, it conduces much to his praiſe, and honour, it ſends him away with the credit of an approved lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man. It is ſo in the examination of faith. In trying faith there is an exerciſe of faith, and by exerciſe it is but increaſed and manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, who knowes but his faith may come to a <hi>fiery triall,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. and 4. 12. <hi>Bilney</hi> firſt <hi>tried his finger</hi> by himſelfe in the Candle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tried his whole body in the fire at the ſtake. How ſhall our faith abide the fiery triall by others, if it have never beene put to this triall by
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:260:154"/> our ſelves? When fiery trials come, how many mens faith which was thought more precious than gold, proves more vile than droſſe? And what is the reaſon? Therefore failes their faith in fiery trials, becauſe it was never put to, nor would abide ſelfe-triall, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>If thou haſt run with the Footmen, and they have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee, then how canſt thou match thy ſelfe with Horſes?</hi> How ſhall that faith try a match with Horſe-men, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tried a match with Foot-men? How ſhall he abide a <hi>fiery triall,</hi> that hath ever ſhunned and beene ſhy of a <hi>cloſet triall?</hi> How wilt thou abide to be <hi>tried at a barre, at a ſtake,</hi> that art loath to be <hi>tried in thy chamber, in thy cloſet? Examine your ſelves upon your beds, Pſal.</hi> 4. He will never abide to be <hi>examined</hi> at a <hi>barre</hi> that will not abide to <hi>examine</hi> himſelfe upon his <hi>bed.</hi> Yea, ſelfe-triall is it that prepares, and fits, and traines up a man to doe ſervice in the fiery triall. <hi>David</hi> could not goe in <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, becauſe he
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:260:155"/> 
                  <hi>was not accustomed to it,</hi> he is likely to undergoe a fiery triall of his faith, that hath accuſtomed himſelfe to the duty of ſelfe-triall. <hi>Abraham</hi> was likely to doe good on it, when hee carries not forth a company of raw fellowes from the plough, but armes his trained ſervants, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 14. 14. They will never be fit for <hi>fighting,</hi> that have not beene uſed to <hi>training.</hi> Selfe-triall is <hi>training,</hi> the fiery-triall is <hi>fighting.</hi> They are like, and fit to <hi>fight</hi> that have beene trained up to it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fifthly, is our faith ſo low pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by us, and of ſo little eſteeme with us, that we care not of all other things we have, how it proves? Men will not have Oxen, but will put <hi>them to triall, Luke</hi> 14. 19. <hi>I have bought five yoke of Oxen, and am going to prove them.</hi> Men will try whether their Oxen be good and uſefull; and care we not what our faith proves, uſefull or uſeleſs? what a monſtrous wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of ſpirit is this? Therefore as at all other times, ſo ſpecially be
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:260:155"/> carefull to examine your faith, when to come to the Sacrament. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have men tried it, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament hath beene fruitleſſe; their owne hearts ſeriouſly dealt withal, will witnes to them that their receiving hath beene to little, or no purpoſe. And what hath beene the cauſe of it, but becauſe there was no examination of faith? How can they receive any benefit by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that go at an adventure, not knowing whether they bring that with them, that muſt make the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment effectuall to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How then may a man ſo try and examine his faith, as that he may know the <hi>truth</hi> thereof, that it is <hi>true</hi> faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtles phraſe of <hi>faith unfained,</hi> twice uſed by him to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Faith <hi>without hypocriſie,</hi> as the word is, implies that there is a faith feined, an hypocriticall faith. Therefore it
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:260:156"/> is not a needleſſe queſtion to make inquiry, how truth of faith may bee diſcerned. Our times are happy in the abundance of helpes they have in this kinde; and this point being ſo largely and fully handled in many learned Treatiſes that are extant, and in every mans hand; I will give but a touch upon it, and ſo paſſe on. True faith then may be knowne by the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of it. <hi>Every Tree is knowne by the fruits.</hi> When the Spies returned from ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they brought with them a <hi>cluſter of Grapes, and Pomgranates, and Figs, Num.</hi> 13. 23.

By the fruits of it, it appeared that it was a good Land. And ſo the way to ſearch and finde out the goodneſſe of our faith, is to bring forth of the Figs, Pomgranates, and cluſters; that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:260:156"/> by ſhewing them to our conſciences, wee may bee able to ſay, Surely our faith is a good, and a true faith, and theſe <hi>be the fruites of it.</hi> Now the fruits and effects by which faith may be examined, are three:</p>

               <p n="1">1 Firſt, the effects of faith, as it reſpects God, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>Obedience to God and his word, and fruitfulneſſe in all good workes.</hi> True faith is no droane, no loiterer, but it is an active and a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Faith which works.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Your worke of faith.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>The worke of faith with power.</hi> A workeman may be tried by his worke. What is the worke of faith? It workes with <hi>power.</hi> It makes a man with power to yeeld GOD obedience, and to endeavour the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods will, to the which no man hath any power at all. Hence called the <hi>obedience of faith, Heb.</hi> 11. 8.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:260:157"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26. Becauſe faith workes obedience, and no man can give God the obedience of his heart, that hath not faith in his heart.

They who are called <hi>unbeleeving,</hi> Verſ. 15. are called <hi>diſobedient,</hi> Verſ. 16. It is an hard duty to forgive an offending brother upon his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a difficult point of obedience. But yet it muſt be done, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 4. <hi>If thy brother turne againe unto thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> But how ſhall we be able to doe it? See Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, Increaſe our faith.</hi> Faith then where it is, inables to duties of obedience, &amp; facilitates hard works. The <hi>children of Abraham do the workes of Abraham, Iohn</hi> 8. and <hi>Abrahams</hi> workes were workes of obedience. We muſt be <hi>Abrahams children,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can doe the <hi>workes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>They which are of faith, are the children of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> They
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:260:157"/> that have the <hi>faith of Abraham, doe his workes.</hi> Now then hereby let a man examine his faith. Put that queſtion to thy conſcience which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> puts, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes.</hi> Shew the <hi>coates</hi> and <hi>garments</hi> which this <hi>Dorcas</hi> hath made. And ſo many works of obedience as thou canſt ſhew, ſo many witneſſes ſhalt thou produce of the truth of thy faith. But if thy faith be <hi>idle, ſlothfull to doe ſervice,</hi> a faith that workes not, ſuſpect the truth of it, and know that ſuch a faith will not ſerve to admit thee to the eating of the Sacrament. For the Apoſtles injunction in that caſe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>That if any would not worke, neither ſhould he eat,</hi> holds as true in this caſe of an idle faith, as in that caſe of an idle man.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, true faith <hi>beleeves</hi> God, and <hi>depends upon him in all things, and at all times.</hi> It beleeves him not only in <hi>ſome things,</hi> but <hi>in all,</hi> not only at <hi>ſome times,</hi> but <hi>at all.</hi> It beleeves Gods promiſes for <hi>ſpirituall</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:260:158"/> things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. for <hi>temporall</hi> things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 3. It beleeves Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to be his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be juſt, holy, and good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 66. <hi>I have beleeved thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> It beleeves Gods <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Ion.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>Yet forty dayes, &amp;c. So the people of Nineveh beleeved God.</hi> It beleeves God not only in time of peace, but <hi>in times of diſtreſſe,</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tentation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 1. <hi>Yet God is good to Iſrael.</hi> Yea, even then when all things goe againſt it, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Though hee ſlay mee, yet will I truſt in him, Pſal.</hi> 46. 2. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17, 18. faith it beleeves <hi>All things, Luke</hi> 24. 25. <hi>O ſlow of heart to beleeve all that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have ſpoken.</hi> Faith beleeves God in all. Examine thy faith by this: put theſe interrogatories to thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Beleeveſt thou God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for this life, as well as for a better? For thy daily bread, as well as for thy ſalvation? Beleeveſt thou all Gods Commandements, without queſtioning any whether it be his or
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:260:158"/> no? Beleeveſt thou his threatnings as well as his promiſes? Doeſt thou hang upon him and his promiſe, and live upon that in all thy pinches, ſtraights, and exigents? As thou canſt anſwer theſe, ſo mayeſt thou anſwer for thy faith. But this will convince many, not to bee <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> but <hi>faithleſſe.</hi> Oh, they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Gods promiſes with all their hearts: but what promiſes? for life and ſalvation. But how beleeve they Gods promiſes for the things of this life? Let that be judged by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, worldlineſſe, their cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immoderate cares, <hi>He that beleeves makes not haſte. Iſay</hi> 28. Therefore he that makes haſte doth not beleeve. Such haſte to be rich, ſuch haſte after the world, ſuch carking, caring, ſuch pining and whining; what doth it but proclaime their groſſe diſtruſt in Gods providence, and promiſes? Thou that beleeveſt not God for thy body, beleeveſt him leſſe for thy ſoule. Thou that beleeveſt not God
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:260:159"/> for a cruſt, beleeveſt him leſſe for a Crowne. Try men in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, pinch and preſſe them with the very letter of the Law. Tuſh they will never beleeve that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch ſtrictneſſe. Try them with threatnings, and thunder them ever ſo againſt them, yet they have not ſo much faith as the divels, <hi>who beleeve and tremble.</hi> Let meanes bee wanting, or meanes be againſt them, and they are of <hi>Thomas</hi> his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Except I ſee and feele, I will not beleeve.</hi> Whileſt all is with men as they would have it, they are full of faith; but let God pinch them, and bring them into a ſtrait, and where is their faith then?</p>

                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:260:159"/> if awake, hath no great liſt to come before GODS face; but when once by true faith in CHRISTS bloud, guilt is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and by faith a man is made friends with GOD, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 23. Then ſhall a man have the boldneſſe of a friend to come to the LORD in prayer. Many that have not a dramme of faith are bold enough, For who ſo bold as blinde Bayard, as ignorant and ſilly ones are. But yet there is a great difference betweene the boldneſſe of a friend, and the boldneſſe of a ſtranger. For Strangers may bee bold with a kinde of ſawcineſſe and intruſion, but they are not ſo welcome as bold; neither hath a ſtranger that ground for, nor that contentment in his boldneſſe that a friend may have; his heart will ſecretly check him, though hee face it out for the preſent, and be ready to tell him, that hee goes further than civility,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:260:160"/> and good manners can warrant him. But a friends boldneſſe is out of that ſweetneſſe of intereſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and intimate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each with other. So that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which faith breeds, is from that knowledge of God, that peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and acquaintance it hath with God in Chriſt. This is that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſſe, and acceſſe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence through the faith of him. Heb.</hi> 4 16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.</hi> But how ſhall we doe to come boldly? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neere with a true heart in a full aſſurance of faith.</hi> A man may therefore try his faith, by the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his heart in prayer. If with a friendlike boldneſſe, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his gracious acceptance we can come unto God, and with ſuch a boldneſſe can powre out our hearts unto him, it is a comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of faith. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhewes how far moſt men are
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:260:160"/> from faith. Deale truly with thy ſelf; ſpeakeſt thou not to God in prayer, as to a ſtranger, as to one with whom thou haſt no intire fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity or acquaintance? Certainly true faith is better acquainted with God than ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, a <hi>deſire of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and his ſecond comming to judgement.</hi> We walke here by <hi>faith</hi> and not by <hi>ſight.</hi> But where faith is, it longs to be turned into ſight, and to have the immediate fruition of the Lord Ieſus. Therefore the voice of faith is that, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Make haſte my beloved, and be like unto the Roe.</hi> And that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. <hi>Come Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, come quickly,</hi> not onely <hi>come,</hi> but <hi>quickly;</hi> that is, make haſte with that ſpeed that the Roe runnes withall. Hence beleevers are ſaid, not only to looke for the bleſſed hope and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Saviour Chriſt, but alſo to <hi>haſten the appearing of him,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Looking for and haſting unto the comming of the day of God.</hi> For though
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:260:161"/> in another caſe it is true which the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſay</hi> 28. <hi>Hee that beleeves makes not haste,</hi> yet in this caſe, hee that <hi>beleeves moſt,</hi> makes <hi>moſt haſte,</hi> and cannot but make haſte, and therfore makes haſte, becauſe he beleeves. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that faith in her deſires haſtens the appearance of CHRIST, when as it is the beleeving ſoules ſolemn mariage day. What eſpouſed Bride longs not for the mariage day, when ſhee ſhall enjoy her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome? Faith unites Chriſt and the beleever, and contracts them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now when once the contract is paſt, there followes a longing for the mariage-day. And this longing after the mariage-day, is a ſigne of a contract made by faith. Doth thy ſoule then long for thoſe bleſſed nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials with the Lord Chriſt, when thy ſoule ſhall have the fill of his Love? Doth the Spirit in thee cry, Come Lord Ieſus, make haſte my beloved? Oh happy ſignes of true faith. But
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:260:161"/> now enter into thy ſoule, O thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous worldling, and thou voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous epicure, &amp;c. Deale ſeriouſly and honeſtly, and tell the plaine truth. Is there any one thing in the world thou thinkeſt leſſe upon, wiſheſt leſſe, or dreadeſt more, than the comming of Chriſt? When S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>judgement to come,</hi> before <hi>Foelix, he trembled.</hi> How many boaſt of righteouſneſſe, even of the righteouſneſſe of faith, but how troubleſome are the thoughts of the judgement, and Chriſt, to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? How heartily could they wiſh, oh that that day might never come. Let ſuch as cannot rejoyce in the thoughts of that day in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and deſire it as the day of their refreſhing, queſtion, if not the truth, yet the ſtrength of their faith</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, <hi>The effects of faith in regard of our ſelves.</hi> And they are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, the <hi>Operation and effectuall working of the Word upon our hearts:</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:260:162"/> faith is that which makes all Gods Ordinances effectuall, and ſo the word, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>The word of God which effectually workes in you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> Indeed, the word workes on thoſe that beleeve not; workes their hearts to rage and rebellion, workes to their hardning and damnation. But it workes no good thing, when faith is not to ſet it on worke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>The word which they heard profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith.</hi> The Goſpell is the <hi>power of God to every one that beleeves, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. Faith is as the vitall and naturall heat of the ſoule. If the body be dead, and without naturall heat, give a man the moſt ſtirring and working Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick that is, and yet it workes not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there wants a principle of life and heate, to ſet it on worke. Iuſt ſo is it here. The word diſpenſed in the moſt powerfull manner that can bee, workes not upon an unbeleeving heart, becauſe the heart is dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: but if any faith in the heart,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:260:162"/> it makes the Word worke effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Try thy ſelfe by this: workes the Word upon thy ſoule? workes it thee to a conformity to it ſelfe, ſo as thou art caſt into the mould of it. Such efficacy of the Word argues a preſence of faith in thine heart. But how many diſcovers this to be void of faith? How many have lived all their dayes, and are even growne gray under the Goſpell, and yet what grace or goodneſſe have all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that ever they have heard wrought in them, more than in ſuch as ſcarce in all their dayes ever heard Sermon? Nay, what is wrought in many, but ſcorne, rebellion, reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſobedience, wrath, ſwelling, and helliſh boiling of the heart, both againſt Miniſter and doctrine? Are theſe the workes of faith? or is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſigne that he workes in their hearts, that <hi>effectually workes in the children of diſobedience.</hi> This is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſigne that a man is in the ſtate of unbeleefe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:260:163"/> 2 Secondly, <hi>Sanctification, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of heart and life, Acts</hi> 15. 9. their hearts <hi>were purified by faith.</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiſme may waſh thy hands, but faith waſhes hand and Heart. Phariſiſme waſhes cleane the outſide of the cup, and platter, but Faith makes cleane the inward part alſo; yea, there faith begins the worke. Faith is not onely an <hi>holy,</hi> but an <hi>hallowing</hi> grace. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Amongst them which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by faith.</hi> We finde a woman in the Goſpell that had beene troubled twelve yeeres with a bloudy iſſue, who was healed: but how came ſhee to be healed? She <hi>touches the garment</hi> of Chriſt, touches but <hi>the hem,</hi> and yet ſtraightway the <hi>Fountaine of her bloud was dried up, Marke</hi> 5. 29. It is true that it was Chriſt that healed her, It was <hi>vertue that went out of Chriſt that healed her, Verſ.</hi> 30. and yet <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> Faith then fetches healing vertue from Chriſt, and heales diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The faith that is true faith, fetches
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:260:163"/> healing vertue from Chriſt. Every mans heart naturally hath ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſeaſe, as ſhee had a bodily. That diſeaſe which the woman had, did typifie under the Law, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall filthineſſe of our hearts. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Obſerve the heart, from thence are the iſſues of life.</hi> Every action <hi>iſſues</hi> from the heart, the Fountaine of all our actions. This Fountaine is a Fountaine <hi>of bloud:</hi> and all the <hi>iſſues</hi> from this Fountaine, in our thoughts, words, actions, all theſe <hi>iſſues</hi> are <hi>bloudy iſſues,</hi> and very filthy and loathſome before God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 18, 19, 20. Hence <hi>hands defiled with bloud, Iſay</hi> 59. 3. <hi>Bloudy filth, Iſay</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Their way was before me, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of a removed woman, Ezek.</hi> 36. 17. <hi>and Hoſ.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Bloud toucheth bloud.</hi> Many bloudy iſſues out of the heart, one iſſue meets with another, and ſo <hi>bloud touches bloud.</hi> Now when faith is once wrought in the heart, it workes ſtrange cures both in heart and life. There were wont to be <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:260:164"/> 
                  <hi>iſſues</hi> out of the heart, in vile loathſome noiſome thoughts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, wantonneſſe, covetouſnes, worldlineſſe. There was wont to be a <hi>filthy iſſue</hi> at the <hi>mouth,</hi> a deale of vaine filthy rotten communication, bloudy oathes and curſes. There was wont to bee <hi>iſſues</hi> in all the ſeverall <hi>actions</hi> and paſſages of the life. But now when faith comes into the heart, that preſently carries a man unto Chriſt, <hi>touches him, fetches healing vertue</hi> from him, that dries up this Fountaine of bloud in ſome good meaſure, and ſo heales all thoſe loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome bloudy iſſues. It is true, that where faith is, there may be ſtil ſome ouzings of this Fountaine, but yet the flux of it is nothing ſo aboundant, and ſo continuall as formerly. A mans heart naturally is like the Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 25, 26. <hi>This great and wide ſea, wherein are things creeping innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both ſmall and great beaſts: There goe the Ships, there is that Leviathan whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> In
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:260:164"/> the ſea, there be vaſt Whales, huge Leviathans that ſport themſelves, and play in the deepes thereof; but beſides thoſe huge Whales, what a world of creeping and crawling ſmal creatures are there to be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Such is the heart of a naturall man; there be therein, not only ſome <hi>Leviathans,</hi> ſome ſpeciall uncleane and foule luſts, ſome ſpeciall Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſters, but there are alſo <hi>creeping things innumerable,</hi> a world of craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bugs and baggage vermin. That looke as is ſaid of Gods Angels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Thouſand thouſands mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.</hi> So may it be ſaid of the luſts and corruptions of an unbeleeving heart, that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands miniſter unto Satan, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand corruptions are crawling &amp; creeping there. But faith once come into the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only thoſe <hi>Leviathans,</hi> but thoſe <hi>creeping things</hi> are ſtrangely ferretted out of the heart. That as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:260:165"/> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. God ſpake of man in his creation, <hi>Let us make man in our image after our likeneſſe, and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, &amp;c. and over every creeping thing, &amp;c.</hi> So in the new creation, when God ſtamps his image upon a man, and gives him faith, <hi>he gives it dominion over every creeping thing;</hi> ſo that in a gracious meaſure it frees the heart, from theſe creeping, crawling corruptions and luſts, that ſo aboundantly ſwarmed in the heart. It is true, that after faith, ſome Serpent may creepe into the paradiſe of a beleeving heart; but yet, firſt there is not a quarter of thoſe creeping things that were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in multitudes innumerable, and thoſe that be there are not there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loathſomeneſſe and vexation. A cleanly perſon may get ſome vermin creeping about him, but yet they ſwarme not, as in rogues, neither are they about him without vexation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and loathing of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they are in a naſty beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:260:165"/> rogue, that takes no offence at them at all. Now then try thy faith by the holineſſe it hath wrought, by the holineſſe, and purification of thine heart. If theſe old <hi>bloudy iſſues</hi> bee ſtaunched, if this puddle, my ry Fountaine dried up; that now on the contrary thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 104. 34. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet:</hi> if the thoughts of thine heart be ſweet and ſavoury, if thou finde thy heart in a gracious meaſure freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe creeping things, thou haſt cauſe to rejoyce in thy faith. But contrarily, here is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces men ſtill to bee in their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, becauſe they have ſtill their bloudy iſſues. <hi>As a Fountaine caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out her waters, ſo their hearts caſt out their wickedneſſe, Ier.</hi> 6. 7. What ſoule abominations, and ſecret loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſts, are harboured and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within their hearts? What cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, malicious, looſe and adulterous thoughts, with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flux, iſſue out of their ſoules? yea,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:260:166"/> and that with delight, following, and contentfully purſuing them in their ſpeculations. God ſpeakes of <hi>dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable things</hi> he will ſave his people from, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 23. But now thoſe mens <hi>detestable things</hi> are their <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable things.</hi> A ſigne no faith in their hearts. What litters and legions of creeping things in their hearts, yea, and that without any controll, yea, with much pleaſure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? A ſigne of a faithleſſe heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, <hi>A ſtrife and ſtrugling againſt, with a victory and conqueſt over ſinne and Satan, corruptions, and tentations.</hi> Where faith once comes into the heart, there followes that conflict and combate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Fleſh againſt ſpirit, and ſpirit againſt fleſh.</hi> All was jolly quiet at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> before S. <hi>Paul</hi> came thither, but when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was once gotten in, and had ſome footing there, ſee what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 23. <hi>And the ſame time there aroſe no ſmall ſtir about that way;</hi> namely, that way of God that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:260:166"/> taught, or as ſome coppies have it, <hi>Againſt that way;</hi> and wee ſee in the ſtory, what hurly-burlies <hi>Demetrius</hi> raiſed in <hi>Epheſus. When the ſtrong man armed, keepes his Pallace, his goods are in peace:</hi> all pretty quiet and faire, whileſt a man in the ſtate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe; but <hi>when a ſtronger than he ſhall come upon him,</hi> when faith comes, and ſhall ſet upon the diſpoſſeſſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and corruption, and they perceive that by faiths entrance, their trading, and <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhall downe; then there is to doe, then there followes no ſmall ſtir. It is with a man then, as with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Wee had no reſt, but we were troubled on every ſide, without were fightings, within were feares.</hi> When once faith comes into the heart, a Chriſtians heart is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccas</hi> wombe: there is an <hi>Eſau</hi> and a <hi>Iacob</hi> ſtrugling and ſpurning each at other. There is an <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt a <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and a <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet in this combate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:260:167"/> faith makes a man victorious, gets the better of tentations, ſubdues, mortifies, and vanquiſhes, rebellious luſts and corruptions. <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſtruggle, but the <hi>elder muſt ſerve the younger.</hi> Though corruption bee the elder, as being borne into the world with a man, yet it muſt bee made a ſervant when faith comes. Faith is another <hi>Rachel, Gen.</hi> 30. 8. <hi>With the wreſtlings of God have I wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtled, and I have prevailed.</hi> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene faith and luſts, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Now there was long warre betweene the houſe of Saul, and the houſe of David, but David waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the houſe of Saul wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed weaker and weaker.</hi> There is a continuall truceleſſe warre beweene faith and luſts, corruptions, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but faith waxes ſtronger and ſtronger, and corruption and luſt waxes weaker and weaker. Faith is the maſter of the field, though there be enemies up in armes.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:260:167"/> Faith is a victorious grace, like him that rode on the white Horſe, <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps</hi> 6. 2. <hi>It goes forth conquering, and to conquer.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. <hi>This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.</hi> It overcomes the men of the world, the luſts of the world, and ſo all other luſts. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the divell himſelfe, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Reſiſt the divell and hee will flye from you.</hi> When the enemy flies there is a victory. Whence is this victory? from reſiſtance. But whence comes power to reſiſt? that comes from faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> The ſhield of faith hath a rare excellency above other ſhields, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> It is not only a <hi>fencing,</hi> but a <hi>quenching</hi> ſhield: it not onely <hi>keepes off,</hi> but <hi>puts out</hi> the fire. And ſo it mortifies and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, all our luſts, and ſubdues and brings them under. As in that caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33, 34. <hi>Through faith they</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:260:168"/> 
                  <hi>ſubdued Kingdomes, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi> So doth faith worke the ſame ſpirituall effects ſtill. In whoſe heart once it is, it ſubdues therein the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of luſt, and the dominion of corruption, it unthrones them; it makes a man valiant to fight againſt, and puts to flight his luſts. That faith that layes hold on Chriſt crucified, doth fetch crucifying vertue from him, whereby it weakens and infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the body of corruption. By this try we our faith. If we finde thoſe wreſtlings and ſtruglings againſt, and power, and victory, over our luſts, conclude thereupon the preſence of a lively and powerfull faith: but the want of theſe argue a want of faith. There is indeed a ſtrife betweene the judgement and affections of an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever; betweene his minde, judging ſuch an action to bee againſt credit, profit, &amp; his ſenſuality headſtrongly headlonging him upon its ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet not between wil and will,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:260:168"/> affection and affection, minde and minde, no ſtrife in the ſame faculty, as in a beleever. And there may bee a victory that an unbeleevers minde and his judgement may have over his ſenſuality, pleading to him his loſſe of credit, profit, friends, &amp;c. which is but a bare reſtraining of corruption in ſome one particular; but this is far from a victory, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mortifying, the power and body of ſin, to bring it into a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing conſumption, which is the worke of faith. Sin may live, yea, and rebell in a beleeving heart; for it is with luſts in a beleevers heart, as with thoſe beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſt of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and a time.</hi> They had their lives for a time prolonged, but their dominion was taken away. So in a beleever, his luſts have <hi>their lives prolonged</hi> for a time, but yet <hi>their dominion is taken away;</hi> they live, but they live ſlaves, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:260:169"/> they dye gradually, both they, and their rebellions.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, <hi>True faith growes and increaſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Christ:</hi> yea, it growes exceedingly, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Your faith growes exceedingly:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God is revealed from faith to faith.</hi> Graines of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed grow to the procerity, and ſpred of trees, in which the fowles of heaven may neſtle. Men may try themſelves by this. So much <hi>growth,</hi> ſo much <hi>truth</hi> of faith. But how would it puzzle the moſt to find any ſuch growth. They have beleeved ever ſince they can remember, and yet what beleeve they more now, than at the firſt. The faith that grows not, lives not; the faith that lives not, is dead. Moſt mens faith therefore is fit for the grave. Lord, ſaies <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> of <hi>Lazarus, Hee by this time ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for he hath beene dead foure dayes.</hi> And what is theirs then but a carrion faith,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:260:169"/> that hath beene dead more than ſo many yeeres? for what more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtrength have they, then at firſt? what more experience of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? what neerer acquaintance with Chriſt? or what ſweeter communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him? Not a jot, therefore not a jot of true faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, <hi>Effects reſpecting our brethren;</hi> and they are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>Mercy, Love, Compaſsion, and beneficence,</hi> to the members of Chriſt in neceſſity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Faith workes by love,</hi> as by love to God, ſo alſo to our brethren. Therfore ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten joyned together, as an individuall paire, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. And therefore when <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſhould be converted to the faith, ſhe ſhould leave hoarding and heaping up her wealth, and ſhould find another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of imployment for it, namely, to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>cloath</hi> Gods Saints, <hi>Iſay</hi> 23. 18. <hi>Her merchandiſe ſhall not be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured nor layed up, for her merchandiſe ſhall be for them that dwell before the</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:260:170"/> 
                  <hi>Lord, to eat ſufficiently, and for durable cloathing.</hi> When <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſhould once beleeve ſhe ſhould <hi>trade</hi> in a new kind of merchandiſe, ſhe ſhould <hi>trade</hi> in workes of mercy and bounty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and refreſhing the neceſſities of Gods Saints. Faith is full of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, tender-hearted, and open-handed to Chriſts members in want. She is a right <hi>Dorcas, Acts</hi> 9. 39. that makes coates and garments, to cloath and keepe warme the backs and loynes of Chriſts ſervants in want. If we finde ſuch compaſſionate bowels in us, hands ready to the good workes of mercy, to do poore Chriſtians good for Chriſts ſake, in thoſe bowels there lyes faith. If we do love a Saint becauſe a Saint, that love is of faiths working. How doth this one thing damne the common faith of the world? They beleeve in Chriſt, that they do; but how love they a godly man? Is there any whom they more diſaffect, diſtaſt, or againſt whom they ſhew more imbittered malice?
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:260:170"/> This malicious ſpitefull faith, is not the faith of Chriſtians. Thus divels beleeve, they beleeve, and are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. This is a diveliſh faith; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels ſo beleeve as that they tremble, and yet tremble not to be malicious againſt thoſe that doe beleeve. And what is their bounty and mercy? Alas, they are not only cloſe fiſted, but with the man in the Goſpell, they have a <hi>withered hand,</hi> not able to ſtretch out their hand in any worke of compaſſion. Such a creeple, and ſame-handed faith, is not the faith that will paſſe with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, a deſire, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring others to the faith. It having once taſted, and found the ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe that is in Chriſt, and in the wayes of God, it cannot reſt, but it muſt ſeeke others, to bring them to participate of the ſame goodneſſe with it ſelfe <hi>Phil.</hi> 6. <hi>That the communication of thy faith.</hi> Faith is a communicative grace, and a generative grace. S. <hi>Paul</hi> once come
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:260:171"/> to the faith hath <hi>Timothy his own ſon in the faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. When <hi>Andrew</hi> hath found Chriſt he cals <hi>Peter;</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> hath met with, he muſt bring <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> Faith indeed in one ſenſe doth <hi>impropriat</hi> Chriſt, and ſpeakes as <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God:</hi> but yet though in its application it make Chriſt her own, yet not ſo as it would exclude others; but knowing the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Chriſt doth deſire to <hi>make him common,</hi> to as many as it can, and in that regard ſayes, <hi>Our Lord</hi> and <hi>our God.</hi> So far forth then, as thou endeavoureſt to bring on others to faith in Chriſt, ſo much evidence haſt thou of faith in thy ſelf. But if others ſpecially ſuch as neere unto thee may be what they will, for any care or endeavour of thine, it is an evill ſigne, that thou thy ſelfe wanteſt that, to which thou haſt no care to bring others. Many other trials might be added for the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our faith, but theſe ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, referring the Reader to the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:260:171"/> treatiſes, of ſuch as have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their profitable paines in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

How true <hi>repentance</hi> may be diſcerned, we may know by that ſpeech of <hi>Iohn Baptist, Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Bring forth fruits therefore worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> fruits meet for repentance, ſuch as become, and evidence repentance: where true repentance is, there bee ever ſuch fruits. And thoſe fruits are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>ſhame for ſin.</hi> True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ever accompanied with ſhame, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 16. 61. <hi>Then ſhalt thou remember thy wayes,</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:260:172"/> 
                  <hi>and be aſhamed;</hi> yea, it ſo individually goes with repentance, that it is put for repentance it ſelfe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>That they may be aſhamed;</hi> that is, that they may repent and reforme their evill courſe. The Heathens ſaid, <hi>That bluſhing was the colour of Vertue:</hi> meaning, that it was a good ſigne to ſee a man bluſh and be aſhamed when he had done amiſſe. And we may truly ſay, that bluſhing is the colour of Repentance, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6. <hi>I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and bluſh to lift up my face.</hi> It is true indeed, that men may bee and are aſhamed, that are far enough from repentance. There is a ſhame of the <hi>face,</hi> and a ſhame of the <hi>heart:</hi> they have the ſhame of <hi>face,</hi> but not the ſhame of <hi>heart.</hi> And if they have the ſhame of heart, yet there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kinde of that ſhame. 1. Firſt, the ſhame of a thiefe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 26. <hi>As the thiefe is aſhamed when he is found, ſo is the houſe of Iſrael aſhamed.</hi> And ſo there is the ſhame of any infamous ſinner, which ariſes from the diſgrace
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:260:172"/> and diſcredit of his action, that hee hath done ſuch a thing by which hee hath crackt his credit, or may bring himſelfe to ſome ſhamefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the whip, ſtocks, or the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. So wicked men may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their ſins in their heart and conſcience, becauſe of that ſhame their ſinne will bring them unto in hell. 2. Secondly, there is a ſhame of a ſonne or childe, a filiall gracious ſhame of heart and conſcience; and that is, when a mans ſhame riſes not from the ſhamefull conſequents that follow ſin; but out of a ſight of the filthineſſe, and loathſome baſeneſſe of their ſinnes, they ſee them ſo naſty and ſo filthy, that it makes them aſhamed that they have defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch filth. And this is the ſhame that is in the cheeks of true repentance. There is a great deale of difference betweene the ſhame of a thiefe when he is taken, and the ſhame of a man that fals into a puddle, into the kennell, or the myre: a thiefe is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:260:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> aſhamed, becauſe ſome diſgrace will light upon him, or ſome puniſhment of ſhame. A man that is fallen into the myre, or kennell, he is aſhamed; but his ſhame is from the filthy, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, unſavoury pickle that he is in. So a wicked man hath ſhame of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe his conſcience tels him he ſhall come to ſhame in hell: but a true penitent man hath ſhame of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe his conſcience tells him, that he hath defiled and beſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe with loathſome filth. And ſuch a ſhame as this, may prove a ſurer ſigne of repentance then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſorrow may doe. There may be a griefe and a ſorrow for ſin, that may come from the ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of wrath, and ſuch a griefe will not evidence true repentance: but a ſhame for ſinne, out of the ſenſe of the filthineſſe and vileneſſe of ſinne, is an unfailing evidence of the faith of repentance. If upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we can finde ſuch a ſhame in our ſoules, if with <hi>Ezra</hi> wee are
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:260:173"/> 
                  <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and <hi>bluſh</hi> to lift up our face, not becauſe our ſhamefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are increaſed over our heads, not becauſe our treſpaſſes will ſinke us downe into hell, but becauſe <hi>Our iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſſe is growne up to the heavens:</hi> ſuch ſhame yeelds comfort. But few are thus aſhamed of ſinne; now how many <hi>glory in their ſhame,</hi> in their ſinne, which ſhould be, and is their ſhame. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complaines of a <hi>brow of braſſe, Iſaiah</hi> 48. 4. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> of an <hi>Whores forehead, Ierem.</hi> 3. 3. And <hi>Zephany, Of ſinners that know no ſhame, Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. Sinners have loſt thoſe few remaining ſparkes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty they were wont to have, and are ſo farre from being aſhamed of their ſins, that they rather count it a ſhame not to ſinne. May not the <hi>Lord</hi> ſay of many now, as he twice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 15. 8. 12. <hi>Were they aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when they had committed abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? nay, they were not at all aſhamed,</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:260:174"/> 
                  <hi>neither could they bluſh.</hi> And are not men growne to that height of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> impudency, <hi>Iſay</hi> 3. 9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witnes againſt them, and they declare their ſin as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they hide it not.</hi> Is the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard aſhamed of his drunkenneſſe? <hi>They that are drunke, are drunke in the night,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. Drunkenneſſe then had ſome ſhame, it ſought to mantle it ſelf with the darkneſſe of the night. But are men now aſhamed of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe in the open day, in the open ſtreets? So for ſwearers, adulterers, and others. Such impudency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes mens impenitency in an high degree: ſuch perſons are as far from repentance, as they are from ſhame.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, <hi>deepe ſorrow, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty griefe for ſin.</hi> Where conſider two things: 1. firſt, The object of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſorrow. 2. ſecondly, The depth and greatneſſe of it. Both will try truth of repentance.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, the <hi>object</hi> of repenting ſorrow, is <hi>ſin.</hi> It is ſin that ſpecially
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:260:174"/> afflicts and diſquiets a repenting ſoul, that is the thing that wrings and pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it. Where was it that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals ſhooe did ſpecially wring him? <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 21. <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt heaven;</hi> that is, againſt God in heaven: he doth not ſay, Father I am in a depth of miſery, ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger, in that pinching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe that I would be glad to eate husks with Hogs. But, <hi>Father I have ſinned.</hi> This is the griefe of a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſoule, that Gods Majeſty hath beene offended in and by his ſinnes. This was that which lay heavieſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſate cloſeſt to <hi>Davids</hi> heart. He neither cries out of his diſcredit and ſhame in the world, nor yet ſpeakes a ſyllable of wrath, or hell; but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3, 4. <hi>My ſin is ever before me, against thee only have I ſinned, and have done this evill in thy ſight.</hi> My ſinne is ever before me, not <hi>Hell and damnation is ever before me;</hi> not the ſhame and reproach of the world, but <hi>my ſin</hi> is ever before me. It is this,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:260:175"/> Lord that pinches and diſquiets mee, that I have ſinned and done this evill in thy ſight. A good heart feares more the committing of ſin, than the ſuffering of puniſhment following it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 9. <hi>Give me not poverty, leſt I be poore, and steale, and take the name of my God in vaine.</hi> He doth not ſay, leſt I be poore, and ſteale, and bring my ſelfe under the Magiſtrates ſword, or thy wrath; but he lookes only at the ſin, leſt <hi>I steale, and take thy Name in vaine.</hi> He feares the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of GODS Name more, than the bringing of his owne name and perſon in queſtion. And to this purpoſe is that which <hi>Elihu</hi> charges <hi>Iob withall, Iob</hi> 36. 21. <hi>Regard not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for this thou haſt choſen rather than affliction;</hi> that is, thou haſt rather choſen ſin and iniquity, than pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affliction: as if he had ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as thou haſt vainely, and raſhly, expoſtulated with <hi>God,</hi> V. 20. deſiring death, rather than to beare this affliction: thou art guilty of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:260:175"/> and ſinneſt in this thy choice. This therefore implies, that a good heart would rather chooſe <hi>affliction,</hi> than <hi>iniquity;</hi> to ſuffer affliction, than to do iniquity. Now, as a good heart is more afraid of ſin, than affliction and puniſhment; ſo likewiſe a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart is more grieved for ſinne committed, then for ſorrow to bee ſuffered. We ſhall finde <hi>David</hi> in great anguiſh and diſtreſſe of ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 17. 18. <hi>The troubles of mine heart are inlarged, oh bring thou mee out of my distreſſes;</hi> wringing, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing anguiſhes <hi>looke upon my affliction and my paine.</hi> Here be troubles of heart, diſtreſſes of ſpirit, affliction, and paine. But what is it now, that thus wrings, diſtreſſes, and paines <hi>David?</hi> See the laſt words, <hi>And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all my ſinnes,</hi> not forgive all my puniſhments; <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, not his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, was his paine. Wee ſhall ſee the like in him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>I have ſinned greatly, I beſeech thee take away the iniquity of thy ſervant:</hi> hee
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:260:176"/> mentions not the taking away of any <hi>ſmart:</hi> nay, Verſ. 17. He is willing to beare it, <hi>I have ſinned, let thine hand be againſt me.</hi> He begs that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment may be laid upon him, but begs that his iniquity may be taken away. Let God be pleaſed to take away his iniquity, and he is nothing ſolicitous for the puniſhment: the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of GOD troubled him, more than his perſonall ſmart. So that <hi>Gods</hi> heart were but towards him in the pardon of his ſinne, he did not care though Gods hand were againſt him in ſmiting him with temporall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement. And this will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if wee doe but compare <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> with <hi>David, Ex.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Intreat the Lord that hee may take away the Frogs from mee:</hi> the <hi>Frogs</hi> troubled him more than his <hi>ſin</hi> againſt God, <hi>Take away the Frogs,</hi> but no mention at all of <hi>taking away his ſin.</hi> And when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, a confeſſion of ſin is extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, yet was it not his ſin that diſquieted him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27, 28.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:260:176"/> not take away my ſin, but <hi>take away</hi> the thunderings and the haile. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, Take away the iniquity of thy ſervant:</hi> oh, ſayes <hi>Pharaoh, take away theſe filthy Frogs, and this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thunder.</hi> A repenting heart is more troubled at ſin, then at thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Frogs. It ſees more filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſin, than in Frogs or Toads, or what ever elſe can bee preſented more ugly to it.</p>
               <p>A repenting ſinner hath his eye upon God, and upon his Law. Hee ſees the holineſſe of God, that he is a God <hi>of pure eyes that cannot behold iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1. 13. Hee ſees him a good, gracious, patient Father, and ſo it cuts him to the heart to have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch a Father, and God. He looks upon the Law, and ſees it to be <hi>Holy, juſt, and good;</hi> and this gals him to the heart, to have violated ſo holy and ſo pure a Law. Now wicked men, they looke wholly at the juſtice and wrath of GOD, at the curſe of the Law, and ſo nothing troubles them
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:260:177"/> but the feare of hell and death. If theſe might be avoided, the offending of an holy and good God, the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an holy and a good Law, would not a whit afflict or diſquiet them. Nay, it is remarkable in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that though hee had upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> meſſage to him confeſſed his ſin, and <hi>Nathan</hi> upon his confeſſion had pronounced the pardon of it; yet after this he cries out, <hi>My ſinne is ever before me, againſt thee only have I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Marke then, that even pardoned ſinne, forgiven ſin, vexes and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets a true repenting heart. It pinches him, and diſquiets him, though it be forgiven; it grieves him that he hath ſo played the foole, and that ever he was ſuch a beaſt to offend ſo gracious a God. When the Prodigals Father ſees him comming a far off, he runs to meet him, ſhewes compaſſion to him, fals upon him, and kiſſes him. That kiſſe was the ſeale of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as if he had ſaid, Behold, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee all thy ſin, as when <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:260:177"/> kiſſed <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> kiſſed <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> they both did it in token of full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. And yet for all this, ſee how the Prodigall ſpeakes: he ſayes not, O Father, from the ground of my heart I unfainedly thanke thee, oh how great is my Fathers good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thus to pardon me, &amp;c. but <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> I, but his Father had kiſſed him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teſtified that he had freely forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, what need hee confeſſe his pardoned ſin? Why is he not rather in the confeſſion of praiſe, than in the confeſſion of ſin? Oh no: A repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinner is ſo affected and grieved with the offence of God in his ſinne, that though God have pardoned and forgiven it, yet he cannot but mourne for it, and be afflicted with it, that ſo holy a Law hath beene broken by him, that ſo good a God hath beene offended by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 6, 7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, thy tender mercies, remember not the ſinnes of my youth.</hi> If God remember mercy, hee forgets
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:260:178"/> and forgives ſinne. If God forget it, why doth <hi>David</hi> remember the ſins of his youth? Yes, ſo will a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting heart doe; it will <hi>remember</hi> the ſin that God <hi>forgets,</hi> it will mourn for the ſin which God hath forgiven.</p>
               <p>Now hereby may men try the truth of their repentance. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> can ſay, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> yet was he not to be truſted: and <hi>Saul</hi> can ſay ſo too, as well as hee, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> can ſay, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> as well as them both, and yet not a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary of them all. We may ſay as much, and make large confeſſions before the Sacrament too, and yet be farre from true repentance. Deale honeſtly: if thou be grieved indeed, what is it that grives thee? ſinne, or ſmart. Such as is the object of thy griefe, ſuch is thy repentance. As in the caſe of feare of ſin, ſo is it in the <note place="margin">Qui Gehennas meluit, non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care metuit, ſed ardere.

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:260:178"/> 
                  <hi>ſelfe, as hell.</hi> To feare hell, is to feare <hi>burning,</hi> not <hi>ſinning;</hi> he feares <hi>ſinning,</hi> that dreads <hi>ſinning</hi> as he dreads <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> It is ſo in caſe of griefe: he that is ſorry becauſe of hell, is not ſorry becauſe he hath ſinned, but becauſe he ſhall burne. He is truly ſorry for ſin, that is more grieved for ſinning than he is afraid of burning. If then ſin, meere ſin, without relation to hell, be that which doth diſquiet us, and this be the thing that mainly troubles us, that we have beene ſuch beaſts to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, there is a cauſe of great joy in ſuch ſorrow, it is an evidence of thy true repentance. But if dread of hell, and the feare of being damned, bee the thing that workes this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe in us, there is little cauſe of comfort in ſuch repentance. So may our repentance be tryed by the object of our ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, the <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of this ſorrow, will ſerve to try the truth of our repentance. The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of repentance is not a ſlight,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:260:179"/> overly, ſuperficiall griefe, but a <hi>deepe</hi> and an hearty <hi>ſorrow.</hi> That as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of in that caſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 21. <hi>Thus was mine heart grieved,</hi> or thus was mine heart leavened; that is, his griefe was ſo great, that his heart was <hi>leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> with it. <hi>A little leaven leavens the whole lumpe,</hi> therefore <hi>much leaven</hi> doth it much more; his whole heart was ſowred with the leaven of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Such is the griefe and ſorrow of repentance; it is a leavening griefe that leavens the whole lumpe of the heart, it ſeaſons and affects all the whole heart. Therefore the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance is called a great mourning, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> How great? as the <hi>mourning of Hadadrimmon, in the valley of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo.</hi> As <hi>great</hi> as was the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the untimely loſſe of <hi>Ioſiah.</hi> How great that was, ſee 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. 24, 25. So deepe is the ſorrow, and ſo great is the ſorrow for ſin in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Yea, it is a bitter mourning,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:260:179"/> 
                  <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>And they ſhall mourne for him, as one mournes for his onely Sonne, and ſhall bee in bitterneſſe for him, as one that is in bitterneſſe for his firſt-borne.</hi> A man that looſes his firſt-borne, and his only ſonne, how bitterly mournes that man? Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance mournes ſo bitterly, <hi>Peter went out, and wept bitterly;</hi> they be waters of <hi>Marah</hi> that flow from the eyes of repentance. Nay, though it be a bitter ſorrow, which is for the loſſe of an only ſon, and the loſſe of deere friends; yet in repentance God lookes for a geeater ſorrow than that is, which is for the death of deareſt friends: therefore <hi>Iſay</hi> 22. 12. <hi>The Lord called to weeping, mourning, and baldneſſe.</hi> God in ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prohibited <hi>baldneſſe</hi> in their mournings for the dead, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Yee ſhall not cut your ſelves, nor make any baldneſſe betweene your eyes, for the dead:</hi> and yet God that forbad it in mourning <hi>for the dead,</hi> cals for it in mourning <hi>for ſinne.</hi> To teach how
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:260:180"/> great our ſorrow for ſin ſhould be; that there ought to be a greater ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in repentance for ſin, than of naturall affection for the loſſe of our deareſt friends by death. It was a great ſorrow that of <hi>Davids</hi> for <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 36, 37. <hi>The King wept very ſore, or with a great weeping greatly: and David mourned for his ſon every day.</hi> He <hi>wept:</hi> He wept with a <hi>great weeping,</hi> and with a <hi>great wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping greatly:</hi> And he <hi>mourned daily.</hi> Such is the ſorrow of repentance, a deepe and a daily ſorrow, till God allay it with ſome anſwers of peace. Hence it is that it manifeſts it ſelfe with ſuch outward expreſſions. The Publican ſmites upon his <hi>breaſt, Luke</hi> 18. And <hi>Ephraim ſmites</hi> upon his <hi>thigh, Ier.</hi> 31. 19. And <hi>Ezra rends</hi> his <hi>garment, plucks</hi> the haire off his <hi>head</hi> and <hi>beard, Ezra</hi> 9. 3. All but to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deepe and hearty ſorrow for ſin. By this may men take a triall of their repentance. If thou haſt had a leavened ſpirit, an imbittered ſpirit,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:260:180" rendition="simple:additions"/> &amp; haſt <hi>lamented after the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. whom thou hadſt loſt by thy ſin, as thou wouldeſt have lamented after a deere loſt friend; if thou haſt beene in the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> the greater thy griefe hath beene, the greater cauſe of comfort haſt thou in the truth of repentance. But ſo formall, ſo ſlight, is the ſorrow of many hearts for ſin, that it is a cleere caſe they are ſtrangers to repentance.</p>

                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:260:181"/> 
                  <hi>the Lord ſaid I will deſtroy man, whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beaſt, &amp;c. for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents me that I have made them.</hi> Nay, repentance in man goes further, one <hi>Noah</hi> found grace in the eyes of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and hee was ſpared from the common deſtruction; but here, not one luſt or ſin finds grace in the eyes of a man, that truly repents, but all muſt be drowned in the floud of the teares of repentance. It is with a man that hath the griefe of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it was with <hi>Nehemiah, Neh.</hi> 13. 7, 8. <hi>I came to Ieruſalem, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the evill that Eliaſhib had done for Tobia, in preparing him a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the courts of the houſe of God, and it grieved mee ſore:</hi> but he reſts not there, but goes further, <hi>therefore I caſt forth all the houſhold-ſtuffe of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah out of the chamber.</hi> What ſhould <hi>Tobiah</hi> doe with a chamber there? Therefore he not onely outs <hi>Tobiah,</hi> but out goes all his ſtuffe too. So doth repentance, when it conſiders
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:260:181"/> all the evill that Satan and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have done, and how they have taken up chambers in the heart, that ſhould be the houſe of God, it is <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſore,</hi> and thereupon it outs Satan and all his ſtuffe; neither Satan, nor his ſtuffe, ſhall bee chamberd there any longer. So doth repentance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe Satan of the ſoule, as Chriſt diſpoſſeſſed his body of him, <hi>Marke</hi> 9. 25. <hi>Thou dumbe and deafe ſpirit, I charge thee to come out of him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no more into him:</hi> ſo repentance caſts Satan and filthy abominations out of a man, <hi>that they enter no more,</hi> they are caſt out for ever. Teares of repentance are not onely <hi>wetting</hi> but <hi>waſhing</hi> teares, <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane. Davids</hi> teares <hi>waſht his couch, Pſal.</hi> 6. and ſo much more waſht himſelfe. Baptiſme is called the <hi>Baptiſme of Repentance, Luke</hi> 3. 3. In baptiſme there is a waſhing away of ſinne. And how is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme the <hi>baptiſme of repentance,</hi> if in repentance there were not the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:260:182"/> doing away of ſinne. If a man could ſhed a ſea of teares, yet if he doe not drowne his ſin in that ſea, what were he the better? If a man ſhould weepe his eyes out, yet if he weepe not his ſins out, to what purpoſe were it? Whereſoever repentance is, there muſt neceſſarily follow this forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and caſting off our ſins, becauſe with true repentance theſe two things ever goe: firſt, an <hi>abomination</hi> and <hi>loathing</hi> of ſin; the man that repents horribly, loathes his ſins by which he hath offended, <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6. <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent. Ezek.</hi> 20. 43. <hi>Ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for all your evils that ye have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Secondly, an <hi>indignation</hi> againſt ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>What indignation? Hoſea</hi> 14. 8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I to doe any more with Idols?</hi> Now that which a man <hi>loathes,</hi> and that againſt which a man hath an <hi>indignation,</hi> hee muſt needs put it and caſt it away from him, ſee <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt them away,</hi> namely, their Idols;

The Mariners when they found out <hi>Ionas,</hi> yet faine they would have ſaved him, wondrous loath to caſt him over-board. Many ſee their ſins, and know them to be dangerous ſins, but yet exceeding loth to ſhake hands with them, loth to throw
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:260:183"/> them into the ſea, but will rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their owne caſting away, than caſt them over-board. Never deceive thy ſelfe; though thou haſt ſighed, cried, prayed, beg'd mercy, yet if ſtill thou live and goe on in thy ſinfull courſes, there is no truth of repentance in thee.</p>

Before their grafting they bring forth fruit, but it is bitter and ſowre fruit, wildings and crabs; but new ſiances grafted upon thoſe ſtocks, there is new fruit brought forth. A Pepon being grafted upon a Crab ſtock, the ſtock brings forth
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:260:183"/> no more Crabs, but Pepons, a new and a good fruit. Such a change and renovation is there in repentance, it makes a man a new man, walking in newneſſe of life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde,</hi> and <hi>put on the new man.</hi> How ſhall it appeare that this is done?

But that is not all, there is yet more to be done, <hi>But rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.</hi> So that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not only bindes the hands from <hi>theeving,</hi> but opens them to <hi>giving.</hi> It makes a theefe become a mercifull man. It was the Churches ſin, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. that when Chriſt knockt, and would have had her opened unto him, ſhe neglects him, and puts him off with excuſes.

As faith muſt bee without hypocriſie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. ſo muſt love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. It is dangerous to bee rotten in the faith, it is alſo dangerous to be rotten in our love. It therefore concernes a man as well to examine the truth of his love, as of other graces. Men may doe much and go far in the love of Gods people, and yet not love them as they ought to be loved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they may hold an outward correſpondency with them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace and neighbourhood, they may live quietly by them, and with
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:260:186"/> them, bee free from quarrels, ſuits, contentions, vexations, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them, and in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects may keepe faire quarter with them, and yet for all this not love them as godly people are to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Phicol, Gen.</hi> 26. 28, 29. deſire to live peaceably and quietly with <hi>Iſaac, that there may bee an oath, and a covenant betweene them:</hi> But yet theſe being heathens, could not love <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a godly man ſhould be loved. <hi>They departed from him in peace,</hi> Verſ. 31. <hi>Peace</hi> is one thing, and <hi>love</hi> is another.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, they may preferre, dignifie, advance, and honour them, and yet not love them as godly men ſhould be loved. Beſides Gods ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces, there are oftentimes in Gods children other gifts of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, prudence, learning, fidelity, skill and activity in ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All which may gaine them great reſpect in other mens hearts. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> honoured <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and we
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:260:187"/> ſee his ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 38, 39, 40. So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> preferred <hi>Daniel,</hi> and we ſee his ground, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 47, 48. So <hi>Laban</hi> ſet <hi>Iacob</hi> over his flocks, and we ſee his ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 27. So many a Maſter loves a godly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not becauſe he is a <hi>good man,</hi> but becauſe he is a <hi>good ſervant.</hi> This is ſelfe-love, they love them, becauſe they love themſelves: ſuch men are for their ends of profit, advantage, &amp;c. and for their turnes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of a ſelfe-love, and ſelfe-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, love and reſpect them. That their love of them is not for their godlineſſe, appeares by this, becauſe though there were not one dram of grace and godlineſſe in them, yet for their other abilities ſhould they be no leſſe deere unto them, then now they are with all their graces.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, they may magnifie them, highly commend and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them for good men, and yet not love them as godly men ſhould be loved. <hi>Abimelech</hi> called <hi>Iſaac, The</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:260:187"/>

There were a great many that hated, oppoſed, and vilefied them; but yet among the <hi>Iewes</hi> there were ſome that were of a more tolerable and equall temper; and though they durſt not goe ſo far, as <hi>to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them,</hi> yet thus farre they went, that when others reproached, ſcorned, and calumniated them, they were ready to commend and pleade for them. They would haply thus ſpeake, Well, you may ſay this and that, and ſpeake your pleaſure of them, but when you have ſaid all that ever you can, yet we ſee they be very good people, very conſcionable and godly men, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Here was <hi>magnifying</hi> of them, but yet not loving them as they ſhould have beene loved, becauſe as the Text ſaies, <hi>Of theſe no man durst joyne himſelfe to them.</hi> All this ariſes not from love,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:260:188"/> but from the conviction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon the ſight of the luſtre and beauty of their ſhining graces, and upon the experience of the integrity of their wayes. Conſcience convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cannot but open the mouth to give godly men an honourable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, in magnifying and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, they may doe them many kinde offices, courteſies, and favours, and yet for all this not love them as godly men are to be loved. <hi>Ierobo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Humanity, civility, good nature, and good nurture, may carry men farre in this kinde.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fifthly, they may as honour their lives, ſo deſire their deaths, and yet not love them as godly men ſhould be loved. <hi>Balaam</hi> deſires the death of the righteous, and that his latter end may be like unto his; and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:260:188"/> yet <hi>Balaam</hi> that faine would have curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was farre enough from the love of a Saint. Many when they ſee a godly mans end, may ſpeake ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably of him, and wiſh, Oh that my ſoule might reſt with his, oh that my ſoule might ſpeed as his, for I am perſwaded he is in heaven; and yet all this while not love a godly man as a godly man ſhould be loved.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixthly, they may honour the memory of them when dead and gone, and upon all occaſions give them honourable teſtimonialls for their piety, godlineſſe, &amp;c. and yet not love them as godly men ſhould be loved. The <hi>Phariſees, Matth.</hi> 23. built up the Sepulchres of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſeemed to ſhew great love to their memorials; and yet if they had beene alive, they would have dealt no better by them than their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did. Thus much may be done, and yet love wanting; that love want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherewith a Saint is to be loved. For with ſuch a love muſt a man
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:260:189"/> come to the Sacrament, in which there is ſo ſpeciall an exerciſe of the communion of Saints. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this is not enough, let us ſee then what it is that is required more, that our love may bee ſuch, as will qualifie us for the orderly receiving of the Sacrament. True love then to the members of Chriſt, to godly and gracious perſons, may bee thus knowne.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, it loves them as Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the relation of brethren, becauſe they be brethren, becauſe they bee ſons of God the ſame Father, ſons of the Church the ſame common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and members of Chriſt our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother. When a man loves god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, not becauſe they be great, rich, learned, wiſe, becauſe they may doe or have done him a pleaſure; but meerely becauſe they have Gods Image upon them, in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he loves them, as godly perſons ſhould be loved. When Gods grace in them is the ground, and Gods
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:260:189"/> Image upon them is the Loadſtone of our love, when we love them not becauſe we love our gaine, reſpect, &amp;c. but becauſe we love God, and ſee them to be his, then is our love right, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Hereby wee know that wee love the children of God,</hi> and love them as the children of God, bearing <hi>Gods</hi> Image upon them, when wee love God. That is true love of godly men when our love to them is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, and flowes from our love to God. On the contrary may it be ſaid of many, that they love not the children of God. No, not love the children of God? Why, I love ſuch and ſuch a man, and you will not ſay but they are the deere children of God. I but by this wee know that men love not the children of God, when men love themſelves, and ſeek their owne baſe ends. It is one thing in ſome ſort to love a man that is a childe of God, and another to love him becauſe he is a childe of God. It is one thing to love a godly man, and another
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:260:190"/> becauſe he is a godly man. A man may love one who is a Scholler and a Preacher, but yet not love him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Scholler or a Preacher; nay, it may be he could love him a great deale better if he were neither. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>love out of a pure heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>loving the brethren with a pure heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. When love is <hi>pure,</hi> it is <hi>true.</hi> Then it is <hi>pure love,</hi> when it ſprings from none other Fountaine but the lovelineſſe of Gods grace and Image, in thoſe whom we love.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, true love to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and to Saints; it loves ſuch above all others, the beſt of all others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Honour all men, love the brotherhood.</hi> There is a love, and a reſpect to be given to all men, according to their relations, worth, quality, &amp;c. but yet true Chriſtian love beſtowes its <hi>Beniamins</hi> portion, the ſpecialty, and choiſe of its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon godly ones. It loves a godly religious man better than a
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:260:190"/> learned man; and the more godly a man is, it loves him the more. <hi>Doe good to all, but ſpecially to the houſhold of faith, Gal.</hi> 6. So love all men in their order and degree, but let your brotherly love, your heartieſt and ſweet affection, be towards ſuch as are brethren. <hi>Love the brother-hood.</hi> A love of the <hi>brother-hood</hi> muſt be a <hi>brotherly</hi> love, a love as to brethren. In a Family, a man loves all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but yet he beares a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall neereneſſe and deereneſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his brethren, than to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Love as brethren.</hi> We reade of a young man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. that came running to Chriſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring how he might inherit eternall life. And we reade of <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Chriſt raiſed from the dead, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. It is ſaid of both, that <hi>Chriſt loved</hi> them: of the rich young man, <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Then Ieſus beholding him, loved him:</hi> of <hi>Lazarus, Iohn</hi> 11. 3. <hi>Lord, he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi> Now the young man was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> only he had ſome
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:260:191"/> candour and ingenuity in him, more than uſually was in Phariſaicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſo farre Chriſt loved him, ſhewed loving reſpect and carriage towards him. But now <hi>Lazarus</hi> was a godly and an holy man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt loved him with a more ſpecialty of affection. He loved the one as a morall faire conditioned man, that had ſome good deſires and inclination towards good; but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Lazarus</hi> deerely, and intimately, as a godly and a good man, with ſuch ſpecialty of affection, that it was enough to know him without his Name, by Chriſts love to him; <hi>The man whom thou lovest.</hi> By this try the truth of thy love: Whom loveſt thou beſt? Have the beſt men the beſt of thine affection? Are thoſe deereſt to thee, who are deereſt to God? the beſt evidence that can be of the truth of thy love. But this proves many to want this love, and that they love not the godly as godly men ſhould be loved, what ever their
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:260:191"/> profeſſions and proteſtations of love be. For let it be granted that they love them, yet let it bee enquired whom they love beſt, to whom their hearts and affections are cloſeſt knit. Looke upon thoſe that are deepeſt in their affections, and judge whether they be at the beſt, more than morall and civill; and whether thoſe that be godly and religious have halfe that affection and love that meere civill perſons have. Thou doeſt not love godly men beſt, therefore thy love is hypocriticall; thou loveſt a morall man better than one that is religious, therefore thy love is with diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, true love loves as the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> did, <hi>Gol.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>It loves all the Saints.</hi> Where grace is the ground of love, where ever grace is, there is love, as fire ſtill followes the fuell. Grace hath the ſame beauty in all; and if grace be the attractive of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it drawes affection to all in whom it is. The love that is amongſt
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:260:192"/> Gods Saints is compared to the <hi>oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that was powred upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 2. <hi>It was powred upon his head,</hi> but it reſted not there, <hi>it ran alſo downe upon his beard,</hi> nay, it ran downe to <hi>the skirts of his garments.</hi> So the love that is among the Saints, it diffuſes it ſelfe to all the members of Chriſt, it runs not only upon the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>beard,</hi> but upon the <hi>skirts</hi> of the garments to the very loweſt and meaneſt of Gods people in whom there is grace. It excludes not any whom <hi>God</hi> hath received, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. deſpiſes not any <hi>whom God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, Iames</hi> 2. 5, 6. <hi>Love the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Peter.</hi> He doth not ſay, love a brother, or ſuch of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but <hi>love the brother-hood,</hi> the whole fraternity, ſociety, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Saints, the whole brood and brother-hood of Gods people. Try thy love by this. He that loves a godly man for his grace, that hath no other thing to commend him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends, nor riches, nor credit,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:260:192"/> nor profit, that can love poore god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as well as rich godlineſſe, that can love grace in rags, as well as in robes, in ruſſet and leather, as well as in ſilkes and velvets; ſuch a love to all Saints is a good evidence of truth of love. But when men love onely ſome great and rich ones that have grace, and regard not meaner ones though gracious, it is a ſigne that it is not true love. Yea, it is a blameable errour in many, that though their love be indeed to the godly, yet it is with a kinde of confinement only to ſome as worthy of their communion and affection. It is not to be denied, but that a man may love ſome godly men more than otherſome. Chriſt himſelfe had his <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> and wee ſhall finde that thrice Chriſt ſhewed ſome ſpeciality of favour and affection to three of them above the reſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 51. <hi>He ſuffered none to goe in, ſave Peter, Iames, and Iohn. Luk.</hi> 9. 28. in his transfiguration he <hi>tooke up with him onely Peter, Iames and Iohn.</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:260:193"/> And in his agony when he ſequeſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf from the reſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet he takes theſe three along with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 37. But yet ſuch a confinement of our affection to ſome choiſe ones, as goes with a contempt or plaine neglect, and excluſion of others of meaner abilities and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is an unwarrantable thing, ſuch as will not be allowed by this ſigne of love now inſtanced in.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, true love loves and delights in the fellowſhip and ſociety of the godly. <hi>Love the brother-hood</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Peter.</hi> He doth not ſay, love the brethren, but love the brother-hood, that is, as ſome expound it, the <hi>fellowſhip of the brethren,</hi> and ſo our former tranſlation reades it, <hi>Love brotherly fellowſhip.</hi> Brother-hood implyes ſometimes fellowſhip, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>I will breake the brother-hood betweene Iudah and Iſrael.</hi> The naturall relation between them could not be broken, but their mutuall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and fellowſhip ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:260:193"/> they ſhould be divided and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed each from other. So then, they that love the godly, love their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood, their company, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and communion with them.

Mark then the nature of love. It is not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, it is hardly angred, it is a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing</hi> grace. It is eaſie to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It is a <hi>forgiving</hi> grace. It is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angred, becauſe it <hi>forbeares.</hi> It is eaſily pleaſed, becauſe it <hi>forgives.</hi> Love is a <hi>forbearer,</hi> and a <hi>forgiver.</hi> Try thy ſelfe by this. If thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loth to be provoked, ſuffereſt much, and ſuffereſt long, and art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beare, till the number and weight of the burthens grow ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and unſupportable, that thy back is ready to breake before thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. If thou art willing to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low injuries and wrongs one in the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:260:195"/> neck of another, ſo long as they are ſwallowable, that they would not choake or poiſon thee if thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt offer to ſwallow any more (for no charity bindes a man openly to wrong himſelfe) ſuch forbearance argues that thou haſt put on charity. If offences be given thee, and wrong, groſſe wrong done thee, yet if thou canſt readily, cheerefully, willingly, and cordially forgive, it is a good ſigne of true love. But how farre are many from the truth of this grace in their hearts, who are eaſily off the hookes, and preſently provoked, and all to peeces upon a ſmall offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; nay, it may be upon no offence given at all, only upon an accidentall ſlip, or a faile in a formality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. No forbearance argues ſmall charity. As far are they from love that are of implacable, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable ſpirits; once loſt, and loſt for ever, whom no kindneſſes can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, whom no ſatisfactions can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe, nor no wiſdome can ſet in joynt againe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if a man have done me wrong, and diverſe wayes injured me by offenſive carriages; whether am I bound to forgive him or no, hee ſeeking no reconciliation with me. Am I bound to forgive, where forgiveneſſe is not ſought, and muſt I ſtay from the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have not forgiven one that wrongs me, and ſeekes not peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In forgiving of an offender there be three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1 The letting fall of al wrath, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and deſire of revenge.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The teſtification of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. A ſolemne profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The re-acceptance, and re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of an offendour into former ſociety, communion, and familiar converſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the firſt.</hi> A man is bound to forgive in that reſpect whether the party offending aske forgiveneſſe, or aske it not. A man muſt ſo forgive as that he muſt beare no malice, nor
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:260:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> nouriſh any thoughts of revenge. For though mine adverſary ſinne in his obſtinacy, yet his ſin will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant me to ſin in malice, and thoughts of revenge. If mine enemy will not doe that which belongs to him, yet I may not doe that which belongs to God. Therefore for matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and malice, we muſt alwayes forgive: and unleſſe a man doe ſo forgive as to let fall all malice and thoughts of revenge, he ſins in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the ſecond.</hi> Our Saviour gives a rule, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 4. <hi>If he treſpaſſe againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turne againe unto thee, ſaying, It repents me, or I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> He doth not ſay, If thy brother offend againſt thee ſeven times, thou ſhalt forgive him ſeven times: but if he ſay, <hi>I repent.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſay ſo, or not, I muſt forgive him in regard of malicious and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive thoughts. But I am not bound to teſtifie my forgiving him,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:260:197"/> and to ſay to him, <hi>I forgive thee,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſay, <hi>I repent.</hi> To forgive is one thing, and to ſay I forgive and make a ſolemne profeſſion of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the third.</hi> A man is not bound in that particular to forgive till juſt ſatisfaction be given. Satisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly given, I muſt forgive ſo far, but ſatisfaction obſtinately denied, I may refuſe ſociety and fellowſhip with him. Religion bindes not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an enemy into boſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: now ſo long as he ſtands out in his enmity, he can be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be none other, ſo long as hee ſayes not, It repents him: yea, and though a man doe not forgive in theſe two caſes, yet may he with a good conſcience come to the Sacrament. And therefore marke how our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 23, 24. <hi>If there thou remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, go thy wayes and bee firſt reconciled, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay, If there thou remembreſt <hi>that thou</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:260:197"/> 
                  <hi>haſt ought againſt thy brother.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewing that the barre is againſt the party delinquent, and that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon receiving injury and wrong, ſo he come without malice, and forgive in the firſt reſpect, is not debarred <hi>Gods</hi> ordinance, though he remit not in both the laſt, juſt ſatisfaction not being tendred upon wrong done.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixthly, true love loves fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>fervent</hi> love, and <hi>unfained</hi> love are joyned together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. True love will abound and increaſe more and more, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Yee love all the brethren, but we beſeech you that ye increaſe more and more.</hi> It ſets it ſelfe no ſint nor bounds, it is ready and willing to give and take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for increaſe and confirmation. As fire is not only ready to kindle, when blowne, but ready to catch of it ſelfe any combuſtible matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſtred. True love hates all hypocriticall reſervations, and lets out it ſelfe to the giving and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all opportunities that may
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:260:198"/> prove incentives to it. Thereby try and examine the truth of thy love. A ſparke will kindle to a flame if it bee true. But this one thing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a great deale of hallow-hearted hypocriticall love in the world. There bee that for their turnes and ends can doe more, and diſpenſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will for God and his Commandement: if God and his Commandement, and coales heaped upon their heads, call for the letting fall of their ſtomacks, they cannot ſtoope to it, nay, with ſcorne and pride of ſpirit, reject tenders and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of love. But if ſome end of their own to be compaſſed, or turn of their own to be ſerved, then they can make a ſhift to make ſome ſhewes of love and deſire of friendſhip; but yet with reſolutions to keepe a faire diſtance, that there ſhall never bee an intire knitting, and mutuall cloſing of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and therefore ſet themſelves bounds, and a ſtint, beyond which they are reſolved never to paſſe. They
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:260:198"/> will not be wanting in common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies, civill correſpondencies, but yet for intireneſſe, and intimate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, will be ſure to block up the way thereto, by affected diſtances, and reſervations of themſelves. They will be pardoned for familiarity, that is more than needs. A carriage faire to the worlds eye, that the world ſhall not ſee but all is well, they will frame to, but further they reſolve never to goe. Surely they were as good ſay, they will play the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites with men, and that their love ſhall be with diſſimulation. For love which ſets it ſelfe bounds and bars, beyond which it will not ſtep, that love ſteps not beyond hypocriſie. That love which will not kindle, which will neither bee blowne to a flame, nor take flame, it is love diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. True fire, though it bee ever ſo little a ſpark, may be blowne and be brought to a flame; but all the blowing in the world will never make painted fire burne. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:260:199" rendition="simple:additions"/> are but like <hi>Salomons</hi> ſilverd pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 23. <hi>Burning lips and a wicked heart, are a potſheard covered with ſilver droſſe.</hi> What ever faire ſilverly ſhewes they make, they are potſheards ſlubbered over with droſſe.

               <p>It is needfull therefore that men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their obedience, whether it be ſuch as is required in him that will be an orderly Communicant. True obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then may be knowne by theſe things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>The Grounds of it.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>The End</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>3 <hi>The Properties</hi> of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Grounds of obedience are 3.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, the ground of true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the <hi>authority</hi> and will of God. Gods will is, that ſuch a thing bee done, and his power is ſoveraigne and abſolute to command, ſo as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee commands it muſt bee
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:260:200"/> done, becauſe he commands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall finde, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. that in that one Chapter this one reaſon, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> is uſed thirteene ſeverall times. The meaning whereof is this; ſuch and ſuch commandements I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne you, if you will know the ground why you ſhold obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this is the ground, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> a God of ſoveraigne power and authority, and my will it is that ſuch things be done. And therefore it is that Gods will is brought in Scripture, as the reaſon of the obedience that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>For this is the will of God even your ſanctification.</hi> So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. The ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all obedience muſt be the will and Commandement; that if a man bee asked a reaſon of his obedience, why he doth this or that, he may be able to ſay, I ſee it is Gods will and commandement it ſhould be done, and becauſe it is his will, therefore I doe it. This was the ground of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 4. 5. <hi>Thou</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:260:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>haſt commanded us to keepe thy precepts diligently, Oh that my wayes were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to keepe thy Statutes.</hi> His deſires were exceeding ſtrong to give God obedience in keeping his ſtatutes, and the ground of it was, <hi>Thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi> That onely and properly is obedience, which is done <hi>Intuitu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis,</hi> by looking at Gods will, by having a reſpect or an eye to Gods commandement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it becauſe it is his will. Looke as it is in the caſe of faith, ſo is it in the caſe of obedience. Then a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, when the ground of his faith is onely the Word of God; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves onely becauſe it is the Word and will of God he ſhould beleeve. If a man beleeve ſuch a truth becauſe he hath good arguments and reaſons for it, by which he is led to beleeve it, this is <hi>ſcience,</hi> but not <hi>faith.</hi> Thus is it in obedience, to doe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon other grounds then the commandement, is not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Suppoſe a man doe the ſame
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:260:201"/> ſame thing that God commands, and yet know not that God commands it, this is no obedience: or if a man do know that it is commanded, but doth it not, becauſe it is commanded, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this obedience to God; for as <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion,</hi> ſo where there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Law, there is no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In all true obedience there muſt be a knowledge of, and an eye to the will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Proving what is the will of God,</hi> that is, ſearching and trying, and ſo allowing the good and acceptable will of the Lord, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Vnderstanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi> Both which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imply thus much, that that onely is obedience indeed, which is done upon the knowledge and conſcience of being Gods will. To doe that which is Gods will, and not to doe it becauſe it is his will, is not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. By this may a man try his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. If thine heart can ſincerely witneſſe that the ground of thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:260:202"/> and all thine actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is Gods will, that thou ſeeſt it is his will to have it done, and becauſe it is his will thou doeſt it, ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is upon the right ground. But by this may the unſoundneſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans obedience be diſcovered. Some men come duly to publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods worſhip and ſervice; but what is the ground? Is it the will of God, or the law of Man, or the talke of the World, that brings them thereunto. Many a man is diligent in his calling, followes it cloſe, and it is a thing commanded of God ſo to do. But if a man doe it, not becauſe God wils it, but becauſe deſire of gaine carries him on, or neceſſity of maintenance forces him thereto, this is no obedience to God, but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his covetouſneſſe, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his neceſſities, which call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for diligence and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Second ground of obedience, The grace of faith. True obedience
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:260:202"/> muſt ſpring and flow from faith. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>Of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith,</hi> that is, that obedience which in beleeving we give to God. But yet in a larger ſenſe, all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be called the obedience of faith, becauſe by it we give God that obedience we give him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>By faith Abraham obeyed God.</hi> Faith quickens and enables to obedience, ſo as without it wee can give God no obedience. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Faith stabliſhes the Law;</hi> becauſe it is faith that helpes a man to performe all the obedience he performes to it. Faith is the ground of obedience thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, a man muſt firſt beleeve what the will of God is, before hee will goe about to yeeld it any obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, all obedience flowes from a mans laying hold on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace. In that covenant God articles with us, and binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to enable to obedience, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. Now this covenant muſt be
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:260:203"/> laid hold on for ability and ſtrength to obedience, before a man can obey God. It is true in obedience to every Commandement which is ſpoken of the fourth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 56. 4. <hi>That keepe my Sabbath, and take hold of my Covenant.</hi> In the Covenant there is promiſed ſtrength unto obedience; and this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being taken hold on, ſtrength to obedience is given. Now that which layes hold upon the covenant is faith, which from the covenant fetches ability to obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, CHRIST is the principle of all ſpirituall life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Phil</hi> 4. 13. Chriſt muſt firſt <hi>dwell</hi> in a man before hee hath <hi>strength in the inner man, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 16, 17. Now all vertue to be fetcht from Chriſt, muſt be drawne out of him by faith. And he by <hi>faith dwels in us, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. No obedience, till we have Chriſt effectually working in us, and quickning us by his ſpirit; and no Chriſt but by faith. By this then a man may try the truth of his
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:260:203"/> obedience. If it be fruit comming from a root of faith, it is good fruit. <hi>I beleeved, therefore I ſpake, Pſal.</hi> 116. So if thou canſt ſay, I beleeve, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray, and doe God ſervice, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 38. <hi>He ſaid, Lord I beleeve, and he worſhipped him.</hi> I beleeve, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſanctifie the Lords-day, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and therefore I doe duties of obedience; then is thine obedience true fruit of Paradiſe, becauſe it growes upon the tree of life. But if thine obedience ariſe from a root on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of morality, it is but hedge fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Third ground of obedience, is the true love of God and Chriſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obedience muſt not bee upon conſtraint; but in one ſenſe it is by conſtraint, yet by the <hi>conſtraint of Love,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtrains us.</hi> Love hath ſuch an active power that it conſtraines us to obedience, not only that love which Chriſt beares to us, but which wee beare to him. Obedience to God muſt be filiall obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:260:204"/> 
                  <hi>As obedient children.</hi> Now the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a ſon to his Father flowes from love. The love of his Father ſets him on worke, to do what his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commands. The good ſon in the Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. When his Father bid him go work in his Vineyard, he at firſt ſaid, I will not, but afterwards he repented, and went and wrought in the Vineyard. Now what was it that made him obey his Father: his Father promiſed no wages if hee would go worke, nor threatned him any evill if hee did not worke, but there was only a bare command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 28. <hi>Son go work to day in my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:</hi> here are neither wages promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor anger threatned, and yet hee went. It was neither hope of wages, nor feare of puniſhment, that carried him; but meerely a ſonlike love, and the dutifull affection he owed to his Father, that wrought upon his heart, and conſtrained him to goe, though at firſt he refuſed it. And ſuch is true obedience unto God. Love unto <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:260:204"/> is the weight that ſets the wheeles on going, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>If ye love me, keepe my commandements.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 3. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Try we our obedience by this. What is it that moves to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? If thou canſt plainely ſay, as the ſervant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>I love my Maſter, I will not goe out free;</hi> ſo, I love my God, I will not ſweare, &amp;c. I love my God, therfore I will yeeld him all carefull obedience. If love be the weight and the oile that makes the wheeles run, thine obedience is ſuch as it ought to bee. But this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a great deale of falſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Some men yeeld obedience for the love of themſelves, the love of their credit. Such was the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees obedience, in their almes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and faſtings, onely to purchaſe credit with men. Such is a civill mans obedience, whoſe obedience is only to ſuch commandements, and onely to ſuch branches of thoſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, the breach whereof would
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:260:205"/> blemiſh his reputation, and blurre his credit in the world. Some yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and worke in the Vineyard for their penny, ſuch as doe all they doe with a conceipt of binding God to them; and bringing him into their debt. Some againe yeeld ſome obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience neither for love, nor wages, but for meere feare; for feare either of the penall lawes of men which fence any commandement of God, or for feare of a greater meaſure of wrath in Hell. None of all theſe is filiall obedience riſing from love: Theſe are <hi>obedient workemen, obedient ſlaves,</hi> that dread the whip, but not <hi>obedient children.</hi> It is love to the Father, not wages from the Father, that is the ground of a childes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The ſonne of a poore man that hath not a penny to give, or leave him, yeelds his father obedience as cheerfully as the ſonne of a rich man, that lookes for a great inheritance. If there were no heaven, Gods children would obey him, and though no hell,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:260:205"/> yet would they doe their duty. So powerfully doth the love of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtraine them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, the end of obedience that is obedience indeed, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Whatſoever ye doe, let all be done to the glory of God. Iohn</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that yee beare much fruit.</hi> The maine end that true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience propounds, is the glory of him that commands. When Chriſts people give him obedience, it is the ſetting of the crowne upon his head, what makes him more a King than obedience, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Behold King Salomon with the Crowne wherewith his mother crowned him.</hi> Now this is the main end of right obedience, that the Crown may be ſet on Chriſts head, that it may bring him in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King, the crowned King of the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man examine his owne heart,

                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:260:209"/> what his end is in his obedience. If wee have any other maine end but Gods glory, it makes it obedience to our end, and not to God. How many yeeld that obedience they do, not to ſet the Crowne on Chriſts head, but to ſet the crown upon their owne heads. So doe hypocrites that ſeeke their owne praiſe, and credit, or profit; ſo doe all ſpecially that doe any thing with a conceit of meriting at Gods hand. Such obedience as hath ſquint reſpects at baſe and by ends, is in Gods ſight as baſe as the ends it lookes at.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the <hi>properties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And they are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, true obedience to God muſt bee univerſall. And that in a three-fold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In regard of the <hi>ſubject</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> that yeelds obedience, he muſt do it with the ſtrength of his whole man, and all the faculties thereof, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 4. <hi>To bee kept exceedingly. Pſal.</hi> 103. 1. <hi>All that is within me.</hi> And
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:260:209"/> thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God <hi>with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 In regard of the <hi>object,</hi> and of the commandements to be obeyed. They muſt be all obeyed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 128. The obedience to bee given to God, is a <hi>filiall obedience,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. Now filiall obedience muſt be univerſall, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleaſing unto the Lord.</hi> It is not well pleaſing to God, when chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will obey their parents only in what they thinke good. That is to yeeld obedience upon courteſie, and not upon duty. See what a filiall obedience the ſons of <hi>Ionadab</hi> gave their father, <hi>Ier.</hi> 35. 8, 10. <hi>In all that he hath charged us. According to all our father commanded.</hi> It was but an homely buſineſſe that <hi>Kiſh</hi> ſent <hi>Saul</hi> about all conſidered. <hi>Kiſh,</hi> a man of great ſubſtance, <hi>A mighty man of power,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1. And <hi>Saul</hi> his ſon, a choiſe young man, and a goodly, not a goodlier man amongſt all the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:260:210"/> children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet his father ſends him with one of his ſervants to ſeeke the Aſſes. And though it were but a meane ſervice, yet <hi>Saul</hi> yeelds him obedience. Our obedience to God muſt be a child-like obedience; a childe-like obedience is univerſall to all commandements without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, diſpenſations, and reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Here <hi>Saul</hi> failed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In regard of <hi>all time.</hi> Obedience muſt not be for ſome times, nor for a time. Not for ſometimes, to bee ſometimes on, and ſometimes off, but it muſt be a conſtant, ſetled, even courſe of obedience, that God lookes for. Some men have their fits of goodneſſe, and have their good daies, as men in an ague, but are fickle and looſe hearted, hold not their hearts cloſe to God and good duties. Thus is that obedience which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls <hi>walking with God.</hi> Some take a turne or two with him, go with him three or foure ſteps; but that is not walking with him. Walking
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:260:210"/> with <hi>God,</hi> implies a ſetled even courſe of obedience to him. Neither muſt obedience be for a time, but it muſt be continuall to our lives end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 75. <hi>All the dayes of our lives.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 37. <hi>He ſhall obſerve to doe for ever more. Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Chriſt became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto death:</hi> that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, Vnto his dying day: not onely obedient in his death: but Chriſts obedience as it begun at his incarnation, ſo it continued to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day on the croſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, true obedience is <hi>prompt</hi> and <hi>preſent; ready</hi> and <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> without ſhucking and hucking, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delayes and conſults, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 60. <hi>I made hast, and delayed not. Mar.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>And immediately they forſooke their nets, and followed him. Zech.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>They had the wind in their wings.</hi> Wings, and wind in their wings, to note, as <hi>Iunius</hi> obſerves, their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their obedience. <hi>Thy will bee done in earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> The Angels in heaven are exceeding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:260:211"/> and ſpeedy in their obedience, and therefore mention alſo is made of their wings. It was <hi>Lots</hi> fault to linger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 16. There be that ſay they will repent, and they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their wayes. Obedience makes haſte, delayes not. Where there be delayes, where there is lead in the heels, or the wings be pluckt, or clipt, where men put off obedience to the time to come, they may juſtly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of their obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, true obedience is <hi>free,</hi> willing, unconſtrained, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall come willingly. Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>Then I ſaid, loe I come to doe thy will.</hi> Obedience is not <gap reason="foreign">

True Grace is growing grace. There is a <hi>growing in knowledge,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>A growing in wiſedome,</hi> Luke 2. 40. <hi>A growing in faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. All true grace growes. There bee counterfeit and falſe graces; and this is a maine thing that differences true and counterfeit ones: True grace
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:260:212"/> growes, counterfeit grace growes not. There is a great deale of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a true Tree, and a pictured Tree, betweene a true child, and the ſtatue or Image of a childe. A true childe growes, but the Image growes not, it is no taller nor bigger at an hundred yeeres end, than it was the firſt day it was made. Where there is truth of grace, there is life of grace, and life will put forth it ſelfe and cauſe a growth, as we ſee in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Trees, and living men that are not yet come to the fulneſſe of their growth, they grow becauſe they live. And to ſhew that true grace growes, we ſhall finde in Scripture ſeverall ages of Chriſtianity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are the ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſpirituall growth, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of the growth of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: ye have,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>His conception,</hi> and the forming of him in the wombe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>His birth,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 23. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 2.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>His well-growne age, or youth,</hi> when he is paſt the ſpoone, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Young men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>His full growne age, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. when he comes to mans eſtat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>His old age. Mnaſon,</hi> an old Diſciple, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 16. when a man is growne a gray-headed experienced Chriſtian, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 13. when men be grown <hi>Fathers.</hi> Such as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 92. 12, 13, 14. All to ſhew, that where there is grace in truth, there will be growth. And therefore it concernes us at all times to try the growth of our grace. But though at all times it concernes us to examine the growth of grace, yet in ſpeciall manner doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us before we come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. As the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the Sacrament of our new birth, ſo is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the Sacrament of our ſpirituall nutrition and growth. And therefore is this a reaſon why bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:260:213"/> is but once; but the Supper is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten adminiſtred and received, becauſe a man is born but once, but after he is borne, he ſtands in need to be fed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for his nouriſhment and growth. And ſpirituall growth is a maine end and fruit of this Ordinance. What makes the body grow more, than the uſe of food, in eating and drinking? In the Supper there is proviſion of ſpirituall food to make us grow. So that in this reſpect I may allude to that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>How great is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; how great is his beauty? corn ſhal make the young Man grow, &amp;c.</hi> Gods <hi>goodneſſe</hi> is great in the Sacrament; he gives bread and wine, and with them, to every faithfull receiver, the Body and Bloud of his Sonne; that by the bread of his fleſh, and the wine of his bloud, hee may cauſe Chriſtians to grow. So that it concernes us much to examine our growth, that we may know what good our former recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hath done us. It is a great helpe to our profit in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:260:213"/> to examine our ſelves how we have profited formerly. Then may we know whether we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, when we know whether wee have growne. Such, and ſo much as is our growth, ſuch and ſo much is our profit. And when we finde that we have profited, then may we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſtill expect the like bleſſing upon our uſe of the Ordinance. A man muſt needs go with little cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to the Lords Table, when he knowes not whether he ſhall get any good by going, or not. That man that knowes not whether ever hee have received any good or no, by his former receiving, can have little hope of receiving any good by his future receiving. But when a man ſees he is growne by the uſe of the Ordinance, then he muſt needs goe full of hope to the Ordinance. The way to know a mans growth, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and that by the ſignes of growth. And they be theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>ſpirituall ſtrength.</hi> The
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:260:214"/> more growth, the more ſtrength in ſpirituall things. In nature, ſtrength followes growth. Trees in their firſt beginings are weake, will bend and bowe every way, but as they grow, they grow ſtronger, and grow to that ſtrength, that they are fit for Timber, and the ſtrongeſt ſervices. When a Man is new borne, and a Babe, how weake and feeble a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is he? but as he growes up, ſo he is ſtronger and ſtronger, and is at laſt fit for man-like ſervices. So it is in ſpirituall growth. A man at firſt is weake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. but growth brings ſtrength. The man that growes in grace growes ſo ſtrong, that he can wreſtle with a ſpirituall enemy. A babe or a childe cannot wreſtle with a Man, much leſſe with a ſtrong Man; but a growne Man, he can wreſtle with a ſtrong Man, and haply can make his part good with him, foile him, and lay him on his backe. So a growne Chriſtian <hi>can wreſtle with Powers and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:260:214"/> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. with luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and can get maſtery and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over them. Yea, a Chriſtian that is growne can <hi>wreſtle</hi> with GOD himſelfe, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did. Now when a man is ſo ſtrong, that he can wreſtle with ſtrong ones, it is a ſigne that he hath growth in grace. The man that growes in grace, growes ſo ſtrong, that he can beare burdens, the heavie burdens of afflictions, and of the croſſe. An heavie burden laid on a childes back, would breake his back, but a growne man hath the ſtrength to beare a great weight. <hi>Sampſon</hi> could carry the Gates of <hi>Gaza</hi> upon his ſhoulders when he was a growne man, that would have cruſht him to peeces when he was a childe. He that can beare Chriſts croſſe in any kind, hath a proportionable meaſure of growth. It is then with ſpirituall growth and ſtrength, as it was with Chriſts natural and ſpiritual ſtrength, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 40. The childe grew and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit. So if we grow
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:260:215"/> we wax ſtrong in ſpirit, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is but ſmall.</hi> Small is their ſtrength that cannot beare a ſcorne, a laſh with the tongue, that ſhrink and ſink at a ſowre looke. <hi>As the man is, ſo is his ſtrength,</hi> ſay they to <hi>Gideon.</hi> And as a mans ſtrength is, ſo is a man; if but ſmall ſtrength, ſmall growth, little ſtrength, as little growth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, a mans growth may be judged by his <hi>ſtomack,</hi> by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to his ſpirituall food. So we ſee it is in nature. Young men have farre better ſtomacks to their meat than old men have, and the reaſon is, becauſe they are growing: for where there is growth, there is a more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy expence of the nouriſhment that is concocted; and therefore hunger in young bodies, is counted a ſigne of growth. Men that have done growing are hungry alſo; but nothing ſo ſoon hungry, nor ſo ſharp as yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtomacks; becauſe where nature is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:260:215"/> growing, it cals faſter and ſooner for a ſupply than where it hath done. So it is here. The man that growes in grace, hath an hungry ſoule, a ſharpe appetite; he is never well but when he is feeding, he takes all occaſions to be eating: though he have had a good meale, and have beene well ſatisfied, yet hee is quickly hungry againe. Though he have bin well fed on the Sunday, yet he can have a ſtomack to a Sermon againe, before the week goe about. Though hee have had ſweet ſatisfaction and refreſhment at the Sacrament, yet he hath a good ſtomack to the Sacrament againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moneth come about againe. Growers are hungry, and great fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If it be thus with us, we have an happy evidence of our growth. But this ſhewes how few grow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo little hunger after their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You have many can goe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting a long while together; one meale in halfe a yeare, nay, in an
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:260:216"/> whole yeere can ſerve their turne, and it is enough, richly enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; what needs ſuch adoe? It is eaſie to judge ſuch a mans growth, what it is. Their birth is rather to be queſtioned than their growth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, growth in grace is <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> and <hi>ſenſible</hi> to others. Where grace growes, it ſo growes that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may diſcerne it and ſee it. It is true here, as <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 26, 27. <hi>The ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up, hee knowes not how.</hi> We cannot ſee corn grow, but we can diſcern when it is grown. For when it is come from ſprouting to the blade, from the blade to the full corne in the eare, by theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees it is diſcerned that it is growne, though wee could not ſee how it grew. So though we cannot diſcerne the growing of grace, yet we may diſcern when it is grown. So <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 52. It is ſaid that our Saviour <hi>increaſed in wiſedome before men,</hi> for it is referred to both things there ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>That thy profiting</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:260:216"/> 
                  <hi>may appeare to all.</hi> If corne be ſowne and ſpeere in the ground; yet if it come not up and appeare above ground, wee doe not reckon that it growes. There is no man that growes in grace, but his grace will be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in one kinde or other. A Tree that is ſtinted and growes not, and a Tree that growes and thrives, may bee diſcerned each from other by their very bark and rind, a man may diſtinguiſh them by their lookes. By a mans looks and complexion it may be diſcern'd that a man is growing. A mans growth is diſcerned by his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage &amp; by his voice. A man that hath had a ſickneſſe, that hath kept under his growth, ſo long was ill coloured ill complexioned, but if once his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe bee cured, and a mans growth mends, there followes an alteration of his complexion. So is ſpirituall growth diſcerned; when a man growes in grace, there will bee an alteration of the viſage, an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the complexion. The viſage
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:260:217"/> of a man that growes, continues not the ſame it did before, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>A mans wiſdome makes his face to ſhine, and the boldneſſe of his face ſhall bee changed.</hi> As when we have not ſeene ſome perſons a long time, they grow out of our knowledge, there is ſuch an alteration in their viſage we ſcarce know them, they are ſo altered by their growth, that they looke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the men they were wont to doe: ſo in this caſe, a mans viſage and outward carriage, ſtrangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where the ſoul growes in grace: the outward behaviour of a mans life ſo changes, that a man knowes him not by his former lookes. It may be a mans behaviour was covetous, earthly, carnall, but if a man once grow in grace, he is growne cleane to another kind of behaviour. That look as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 53. They ſaw what he was by <hi>his face;</hi> ſo may a growing Chriſtian be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his face: the life of ſuch a man hath another kinde of face, and of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:260:217"/> lookes with it, ſo as his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wonder at it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. Thus alſo is growth in grace ſenſible by the <hi>alteration of the voice.</hi> When one growes towards mans eſtate, his voice alters and changes, he ſpeakes no longer like a childe, but he begins to have a big and a man-like voice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>When I was a childe, I ſpake as a childe, but when I became as a man, I ſpake as a man;</hi> which is true, not onely of the ſubject, but of the ſound of a mans ſpeech. So the growth of a Chriſtian in grace, is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the alteration and change of his voice. Even in this ſenſe it is true, though ſpoken in another, that they that beleeve ſhall <hi>ſpeake with new tongues, Marke</hi> 16. 17. The vaine, frothy, earthly tongue is gone: hee ſpeakes not vainly, fooliſhly, ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe; but he ſpeakes profitably, to edification, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 31. <hi>He that is of the earth, is of the earth, and he ſpeakes of the earth.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 5. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world.</hi>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:260:218"/> Here is an old tongue. But <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 30. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeakes wiſdome, and his tongue talkes of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Prov.</hi> 31. 26. <hi>She openeth her mouth with wiſdome, and in her tongue is the law of grace. Col.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Let your ſpeech be alwayes with grace. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>That it may miniſter grace to the hearers.</hi> Here is a new tongue: here is a change of the voice, and a ſigne of growth. Looke then upon thine owne complexion, thou ſhalt ſee by it, whether thou haſt grown in grace by thy former receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 15. <hi>Give thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pulſe to eat, and water to drinke. Then let our countenances be lookt upon,—And their countenances appeared fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and fatter in fleſh than all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.</hi> By the looking upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> countenance and the reſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that they thrived and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their pulſe and water. So much more by mens countenances, carriages, and behaviours, if they be looked upon, whether they thrive,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:260:218"/> and grow with their Sacramentall food formerly received. But mens old viſages, and ill-favoured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, are ill ſignes how little growth there is. With too many it is as with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeven ill-favoured Kine, they ate up the well-favoured, and the fat, but were ſtill as ill-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as before. Many come to the Sacrament after Sacrament, and eat and drinke at the Lords Table, but what alteration in their lives? Are not their lives as ill-favoured ſtill as before. Liſten to their voices, and as little change ſhall you finde there, as in their lives. Thus may we examine the growth of grace in generall. But beſides this, there muſt be a ſpeciall examination of the growth of the grace of faith: and that may briefly be thus diſcerned. A growne faith is a great faith, <hi>O Woman, great is thy faith, Mat.</hi> 15. Great faith is ſeene:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, not only in obedience, but in <hi>great</hi> obedience. Great <hi>faith</hi> does great <hi>workes</hi> of obedience. It was a
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:260:219"/> great worke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſacrifice his ſon. No wonder he did it, who was a man of ſo great faith as he hath the honour to bee the father of the faithfull, <hi>I am.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Rich in faith.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Rich in good workes.</hi> It is a ſigne that a man is <hi>Rich in faith,</hi> when <hi>rich in good workes.</hi> A poverty or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery in good workes cannot ſtand with a riches in faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, in great victories and conqueſts over great luſts, where corruptions and luſts are ſtrong, and get head, faith is little, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 30, 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> But where faith growes great, it fetches downe the greateſt luſt, the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated corruptions. As faith of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, a graine of it <hi>removes Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Mat.</hi> 17. 19, 20. <hi>Plucks up trees by the roots, Luke</hi> 17. 6. So much more doth juſtifying faith, when growne and great. Many talke of a great faith, yet cannot remove <hi>Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils,</hi> nor pluck up ſmall <hi>twigs.</hi> Many will ſweare by their faith; how ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:260:219"/> and beleeving will ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I leave it to them to ſcanne. I but this is (they will ſay) a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a matter of nothing to ſweare by a mans faith. The ſmaller a matter it is, the greater evidence that ſuch have not a great faith; becauſe that would get great victories over great evils, therefore much more over ſmall ones. It is no great faith that cannot remove ſo ſmall a Mole-hill, that cannot pluck up ſo ſmall a twig.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, In this, that it can and will beleeve on God, as a man may ſay with reverence, whether God will or no. It will beleeve in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, in a killing God, <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> It will beleeve in a forſaking God, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Why haſt thou forſaken me, and yet <hi>my God.</hi> It will not bee beaten off, not damped, nor diſcouraged with ſilence, nor with ſad anſwers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi> A ſigne it was <hi>great,</hi> or elſe ſuch <hi>great</hi>

                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:260:223"/> diſcouragements had overcome it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, great confidence and ſtrength of heart in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and feares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7. <hi>Hee ſhall not be afraid of evill tydings,</hi> why ſo? <hi>His heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.</hi> A fixed heart in ſuch a caſe a ſigne of great faith. Much feare is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of little faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Why are ye ſo fearefull, O ye of little faith?</hi> Had they not reaſon to be fearefull? It was a great danger they were in, Verſ. 24, 25. True, but yet if they had had <hi>great faith,</hi> they would have had <hi>great courage</hi> and confidence in that <hi>great danger.</hi> For faith foreſees dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hath a quick eye to diſcerne a ſtorme before it comes, and ſo gives a man the liberty of himſelfe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt the worſt, and ſo that errour is taken off which ſuddenneſſe brings with it. And beſides, when a danger is come, faith doth as the bloud of the body doth in time of feare, it gets to the heart, and ſuccours and ſtrengthens it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:260:223"/> 
                  <hi>your heart bee troubled, yee beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me.</hi> Great faith is full of great quiet, great comfort, great courage, and confidence in the middeſt of great feares and dangers. Thus in briefe may a man know the growth of faith. But if a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde his faith ſo growne, yet is it no barre to his acceſſe to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. If a man find his faith weak, yet may he come, yet muſt he come that hee may helpe it hereby in its growth. But the more our faith is growne, the more comfort ſhall we have in comming, and the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ſhall wee carry away with us <note place="margin">Optima diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ad Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtiae eſt, non niſi ea qua peſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me es diſpoſitus, &amp; e contra tunc peſsime es diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus, quando ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsime.

Luther.</note> from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The third thing,</hi> wherein our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination muſt be, <hi>is our wants.</hi> A ſpeciall end of our comming to the Sacrament, is to have our ſpirituall wants ſupplied. If we will have our wants ſupplied, we muſt come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely with that intention. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that unleſſe we know diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly what our wants are.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:260:224"/> We cannot know what our wants of grace are, unleſſe we looke into our ſoules by <hi>examination.</hi> Wee ſhould doe in this caſe, as we ſee ſuch doe as go or ſend to market: at the market there is a ſupply to be had of all the wants of the family; if there want bread, if there want food, if any other houſhold neceſſaries be wanting, they are to be had at the market; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any is to be ſent or to goe to the market, there is an inquiry what is wanting in the houſe. Is there bread or bread-corne enough in the houſe? Is there not ſuch and ſuch a neceſſary wanting? do you not need ſuch a proviſion into the houſe? So when we are to go to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhould we doe with our ſelves. The wants of the ſoule are not a few. There is nothing that the ſoule can want or wiſh, but it may bee had aboundantly in Chriſt, and in him in his Ordinance. Now therefore ſhould the ſoule before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee inquiſitive into its owne
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:260:224"/> wants. Say to thy ſoule, I am now going to the Sacrament, there is abundance of ſpirituall commodity to bee had, now then what is it that thou wanteſt? Doeſt thou not want aſſurance of thy pardon? Doeſt thou not want ſtrength of faith? Doeſt thou not want power againſt ſuch a ſpeciall luſt that hath haunted thee, and peſter'd thee a great while? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not want ſome healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſtaunch ſome bloudy iſſue? Doeſt thou not need ſome quickning in thy ſpirit? Thus labour to ſearch and find out what be the wants of thy ſoule, and what be thy particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.</p>
               <p>In the Sacrament of the Lords Supper wee goe to CHRIST IESVS to have him helpe us in our wants and neceſſities. Now CHRIST IESVS will firſt have us know our wants, and be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſenſible of them, before he will ſupply them. Hee councels the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, to buy of him</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:260:225"/> 
                  <hi>gold, raiment, eye ſalve, Apocal.</hi> 3. 18. But firſt hee convinces her of her wants, of her poverty, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and blindneſſe, that ſhee comming to him in a particular ſenſe of thoſe wants, and making that her errand to him, ſhee may have them ſupplied. It was, one would thinke, a ſtrange queſtion, that our Saviour put to that man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Wilt thou bee made whole?</hi> was there any queſtion to be made of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that a man that had beene ſicke eight and thirty yeeres would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be made whole? It is ſure he deſired nothing more: why then doth Chriſt aske him that queſtion? purpoſely to affect him with the ſenſe of his want, to make him the more ſenſible of his neceſſity. So will Chriſt have men affected with the ſenſe of their wants, that would have a ſupply of their wants from him. It will not ſerve a mans turne in the generall, to know he wants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from Chriſt, but he will have
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:260:225"/> a man in particular be ſenſible of that ſpeciall want wherein he would have his helpe. That is a remarkable place to this purpoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 35, 36. The blinde man hearing that Chriſt paſt by, he cries out, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of <hi>David,</hi> and hee cries ſo againe, Verſ. 39. At laſt Chriſt cals him to him, Verſ. 40, 41. and ſaid, <hi>What wilt thou that I ſhall do unto thee?</hi> Did not Chriſt ſee he was blinde, and did not hee know what mercy it was he beg'd? Yes queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe. But yet he would firſt have him particularize his wants, and in what particular it was he would have him ſhew him mercy, before hee would doe it. Have mercy on mee, was a general ſuit; many wayes might mercy be ſhewed: therefore Chriſt preſſes him to inſtance in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar want, <hi>What wilt thou that I ſhall do unto thee?</hi> what is the particular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thou ſtandeſt in need of, that thou wouldeſt have me help thee withall? and then followes his anſwer, <hi>Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:260:226"/> 
                  <hi>that I may receive my ſight;</hi> Lord, I am blinde in this particular, I have need of thee to open mine eyes. And then Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Receive thy ſight. And he received his ſight.</hi> They then that come to Chriſt to receive any thing from him with a ſenſe of the want of that they would receive, they are they that are like to ſpeed in their receiving, what they deſire to have from Chriſt. I doubt whether hee ſhould have had that mercy, if he had only ſtill beg'd for mercy in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; but when once he comes with a particular ſenſe of his want, then hee findes Chriſt ready to helpe him. It muſt be thus with us when we come to the Sacrament, if ever we will have good by it. Many they come that they may receive good by it, but doe not pitch upon ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good as they need, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not what particular good from Chriſt they want: and that is not knowne for want of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. There is nothing more
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:260:226"/> prejudiciall to mens benefit by the Sacrament than this one thing, that men before they come doe not finde out their wants, and ſo in the ſenſe of them ſeek to Chriſt in his Ordinance. They comming without the ſenſe of any particular want, they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſire of any particular grace or benefit from Chriſt. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without deſire, goe as they come. As our Saviour ſpeakes to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 35. <hi>When I ſent you without purſe, &amp;c. lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, nothing.</hi> So if a man ſhould aske many, When ye went to the Sacrament, <hi>lacked ye any thing?</hi> did you want any thing in your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular feeling? they may anſwer, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And what received they then? juſt as much as they lacked, juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therefore it ſhould be a mans wiſdome, ſo to examine his owne wants, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſay to him when he is come to the Sacrament, what is it that thou wouldeſt I ſhould doe for thee? thou mighteſt be able
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:260:227"/> out of a privity to thine own wants, upon examination to anſwer, Lord that my pardon might bee ſealed, Lord, that I may receive the vertue of thy death, that ſuch a rebellious luſt might be mortified, Lord, that I may receive thy Spirit, that mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane heart might be ſanctified, that I might bee enabled with more ſtrength to performe ſuch a duty, &amp;c. And Lord, upon this very errand, and for this end doe I come now to thee in thine Ordinance, to have help in this or that particular from thee. If once we could come thus with the ſight of our wants to receive, then would Chriſt anſwer, and ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the mercies thou feeleſt the want of, receive my Spirit, receive power againſt thy luſts, receive ſtrength to obedience. They that come for they know not what, goe even away with they know not what.</p>

The <hi>third thing</hi> followes, and that is the <hi>quickning</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> of our <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces.</hi> That which S. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>Timothy</hi> to doe, and which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſtians to do at all times, is of ſpeciall uſe, and needfull to be done before the Sacrament, namely that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>I put thee in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that thou ſtirre up the gift, or grace of God that is in thee,</hi> that thou blow up, and cauſe to kindle, the grace of God. Fire that lyes raked up in the aſhes, here and there a coale, wil not on a ſudden kindle and burne out into a flame, but if a man before-hand
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:260:228"/> gather the coales together, and lay on ſome ſmall ſticks, and blow thoſe coales, and kindle thoſe ſticks, then when a man will, hee adding more fuell, he may have it burne and flame out as he pleaſe. At the Sacrament a man would be willing to have all his graces up in a burning flame; now that will not be done on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but if before the Sacrament we lay theſe coales together, and bee blowing them, and kindling them with ſome fuell in private, then when we come at the Sacrament, they will the eaſier and ſooner flame out. Now the graces ſpecially to be quickned, and renewed, are <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, it is not enough for a man that he have faith, but if a man will come in due order, he muſt before his comming, quicken, awaken, and ſtir up, and renew his faith. Though a man have faith, yet if he come with his faith halfe aſleepe, he comes not in <hi>due Order.</hi> A man that is ſleepy and drowſie, is a true man, but yet he
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:260:228"/> is an unfit man to be implyed in a buſineſſe of weight, wherein he had need to have his wits about him, in a buſineſſe that will require the activity of all his parts and faculties. A faith that is drowſie, and halfe aſleepe, is haply a <hi>true faith,</hi> but yet is not a <hi>fit faith</hi> to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it being a buſineſſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all the livelineſſe and activity that poſſibly faith can have. A man that would have a good ſtomack to his meat, and have his meat doe him good, will a little before his meat uſe ſome exerciſe which may awaken his ſpirits, and ſtirre up his naturall heate: he hath life in his body before, and heat in his body before, but yet if a little ſtirring and exerciſe be uſed before meat, it raiſes a mans ſpirits, prepares for, and helpes digeſtion, and a mans meat does him a great deale the more good. So in this caſe ſome exerciſing of faith, and ſetting it on worke before the Sacrament, would bring warmth and heate into
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:260:229"/> it, and would ſweetely prepare it to worke the more kindely at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo would the Sacrament doe a mans ſoule much the more good. The Phyſicians ſay, that a breakfaſt moderately and Seaſonably taken, gets a man the better ſtomacke to his dinner, becauſe thereby a mans naturall heat is awakened, and the ſpirits raiſed, and ſo the better way prepared for concoction. Doe ſo here, take a breakfaſt before this feaſt, ſet Faith a feeding on ſome promiſe or other, and ſo whet and provoke the appetite of thy faith. A man that is to run a Race, will not put off all to the very point of running, then would he be ſo purſie and breathleſſe that hee would run to little purpoſe, but becauſe he would be ſure to have his wind and legs at command in his Race, he will for many dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee exerciſing himſelfe before the day of his Race, he will run ſo much one day, ſo long another, and ſo will be every day breathing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:260:229"/> that when he comes to run, he may have wind at will, and neither legs nor lungs may faile him. So, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, it is good to be exerciſing our faith, that it may be in breath, and fit to performe its office when at the Sacrament. A faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed before, will prove purſey and ſhort winded, when it ſhould do the main buſines at the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhould a man thus exerciſe and quicken his faith, before he comes to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Take ſome of the <hi>promiſes</hi> and ſet thy faith on worke upon them. Thou commeſt to the Sacrament to eat Chriſt. Before thou commeſt to eat him at his Table, firſt labour to taſte him in chewing ſome promiſe; and that taſte gotten of him in the chewing of a promiſe, would ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepare faith to the eating of him in the Supper: we ſhall conceive it the better by ſome inſtance. <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to come to Chriſt, <hi>Come, for</hi>

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>al things are ready.</hi> We have not only a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:260:230"/> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which yet might have ſufficed, but wee have a promiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Him that comes to me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> that is, I will with all hearty welcome, imbrace, and receive him that comes unto me, that beleeves in me. Why then I ſee, that come and <hi>welcome.</hi> He that <hi>bids</hi> me, if <hi>I come</hi> at his bidding, he will <hi>bid</hi> me <hi>welcome.</hi> Doth my ſoule doubt of it? Why then doe but conſider what Chriſt is now, by what he was when on earth. I finde in the Goſpell that the pooreſt and meaneſt that were might come unto him. I ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 14. That <hi>the lame</hi> and <hi>the blinde</hi> came unto him; they came, and they <hi>were welcome, They came unto him, and he healed them.</hi> I ſee then if <hi>I come</hi> to him, I ſhall finde him an <hi>healing Chriſt.</hi> And how much doth my ſoule need healing? I ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 2, 3. that a Leper comes, a foule uncleane Leper, and yet he is not loathed for his leaproſie, neither doth Chriſt check him, and bid him keepe off, but
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:260:230"/> he was welcome to, and had his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie cleanſed. I never find Chriſt diſpleaſed with any for comming to him, never finde him complaining of any for comming. I ſee none refuſed or forbidden comming unto him. I heare him complaining, that men did not, would not come unto him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. <hi>And ye will not come unto mee.</hi> I finde him diſpleaſed with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for <hi>forbidding</hi> little ones to come unto him, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14. and V. 16. <hi>Suffer little children to come, yea and he imbraces and bleſſes them.</hi> Then I ſee Chriſt barres none from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. My conſcience diſcourages me, and tels me, If I were ſo holy as ſuch a man, &amp;c. then I might come. But what wilt thou that haſt beene ſuch a ſinner doe going? Well, but I ſee the lame, the blinde, yea, the Lepers were admitted with wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. What then though I bee a Leper; yet ſince he <hi>bids mee come,</hi> and <hi>promiſes to bid me welcome,</hi> I will go to him, Lord Chriſt I will come
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:260:231"/> to thee. What ever I have beene, I have beene but a <hi>prodigall,</hi> and I ſee <hi>prodigals</hi> ſhall be <hi>welcome</hi> if they <hi>come.</hi> The Prodigall leaves his Fathers houſe, runs riot, waſtes all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pincht with hunger, bethinkes himſelfe of his Fathers houſe, <hi>I will,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>goe unto my Father, &amp;c.</hi> Go to his Father: alas, what ſhould ſuch an one that hath run his race do go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Father? with what heart or hope, with what face and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, could he come into his Fathers fight? but yet he <hi>aroſe and came to his Father, Luke</hi> 15. 20. And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>But when hee was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſsion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> Behold, O my ſoule, the unconceiveable readineſſe and uncredible forwardneſſe of the Lord to welcome and receive a comming, a beleeving ſinner.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, I ſee that his Father <hi>ſees him firſt,</hi> yea, before he <hi>ſees his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> No ſooner doth a man thinke
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:260:231"/> upon looking towards God, but God lookes towards him. How great is the Fathers deſire towards his ſon! It is ſaid, that after <hi>Abſoloms</hi> three yeeres exile, that <hi>Ioab perceived that the Kings heart was towards Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 1. Thus ſeemes this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heart to be towards his ſonne, yea, that his deſire ſuch, as if he ſate in ſome higher place, watching to ſee when he ſhould come, that he might no ſooner bee within ken, but hee might ſpie him, according to that, Iohn 30. 18. <hi>The Lord will wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</hi> I ſee then the Lord ſtands <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that we can no ſooner be upon our way to come, but he ſees and ſpies us to bid us welcome.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, I ſee that he ſaw him whileſt he was yet a <hi>great way off.</hi> He was but yet in the beginning of his way in comming. His Father might have let him alone till he had beene come quite home to his houſe, and it had beene ſingular mercy to have
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:260:232"/> welcomed him then. But it is done whileſt he is <hi>yet a great way off.</hi> Is the Lord thus ready to welcome mee, when yet a <hi>great way off,</hi> what will he be if I be <hi>come neere</hi> to him. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord that will <hi>draw nigh</hi> to ſuch, as yet, a <hi>great way off,</hi> will much more <hi>draw nigh</hi> to thoſe that <hi>draw nigh to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, I ſee his Father <hi>had compaſsion</hi> on him, I ſee his bowels yerne, worke, and ſtir within him at the ſight of his ſonne, at the ſight <hi>of him afarre off.</hi> Gods bowels yerne within him, towards a beleeving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinner. It is ſaid of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 26. <hi>That her bowels yearned,</hi> or <hi>were hot upon her ſon.</hi> So when the Lord ſees a ſinner come to him, <hi>his bowels wax hot, and yerne within him, Ier.</hi> 31. 18. 20. Therefore <hi>my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him. God</hi> hath not only mercy, <hi>but bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Luke</hi> 1. 78. And theſe bowels be <hi>ſounding bowels,</hi> or a <hi>multitude of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:260:232"/> 
                  <hi>Iſay</hi> 63. 15. <hi>He delights in loving kindneſſe, Ier.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>And he pardons ſin, becauſe mercy pleaſes him, Mic.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, I ſee that his Father <hi>ran.</hi> How rich and aboundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had it beene in his Father, to have ſtood ſtill till he had come at him; but what mercy is this that he will goe towards him, and give him a meeting. Oh mercy, that his Father <hi>ran not from him;</hi> but what mercy call you this, that <hi>his Father runs to him?</hi> If hee would needs goe meet him, why might it not have ſerved the turne, to have walked towards him with a ſoftly and grave pace! No, no: I ſee that ſerves not the <hi>Lords</hi> turne. When a ſinner <hi>comes</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> mercy not only <hi>comes,</hi> and goes a foot-pace, but mercy <hi>runs.</hi> Mercy comes upon the <hi>wings.</hi> Gods <hi>rowling bowels</hi> ſets his <hi>feet on running.</hi> That as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of Gods readineſſe to helpe him, when he called upon him in his danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 6. 9. 10.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:260:233"/> 
                  <hi>He rode upon a Cherub, and did flye, yea, he did flye upon the wings of the winde.</hi> So when a ſinner comes to God, mercy comes to him; not <hi>walking,</hi> but <hi>running,</hi> not on <hi>foot,</hi> but <hi>riding, riding on the wings of the wind.</hi> That looke as <hi>Gabriel</hi> came with an anſwer to <hi>Daniels</hi> prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Hee being cauſed to flye ſwiftly,</hi> or with <hi>wearineſſe of flight;</hi> he not only came, but came <hi>flying;</hi> not only <hi>flying,</hi> but <hi>flying ſwiftly;</hi> yea, ſo ſwiftly, as hee had <hi>wearied</hi> himſelfe with the <hi>ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his flight</hi> to make haſte. So comes mercy to a man comming to Chriſt; it is <hi>cauſed to flye ſwiftly,</hi> with <hi>wearineſſe of flight.</hi> The <hi>Father ran:</hi> mercy comes full ſpeed. Nay, what a difference doe I ſee, betweene the <hi>offending ſon,</hi> and the <hi>offended Father!</hi> The ſons pace is, <hi>He aroſe, and came;</hi> he came walking on towards his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Fathers pace is, <hi>And hee ran.</hi> The ſon moſt needed to have <hi>run,</hi> his belly was pincht with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; yet he onely <hi>walkes,</hi> but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:260:233"/> 
                  <hi>runnes.</hi> Bowels troubled with mercy, out-pace bowels pinched with hunger. God, I ſee then, makes more haſte to ſhew mercy, than we make to receive mercy. Whileſt we doe but <hi>go</hi> towards him, he <hi>runs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Whileſt miſery goes but a <hi>walking,</hi> mercy comes a <hi>running</hi> pace. God, who is <hi>ſlow to anger, Pſal.</hi> 103. 8. <hi>is ſwift to mercy. He ran.</hi> And why then, O my ſoule, ſhouldeſt thou bee <hi>ſlow of heart</hi> to beleeve? up, and run to him, that will come <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> with his mercy, and his Chriſt to thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fifthly, I ſee him <hi>falling upon his neck: And fell on his neck;</hi> that is, he hugged, and imbraced him. How! Fell upon his necke, and imbraced him! Who would not have beene loth to have toucht him? yea, to have come neere him? Is he not in his loathſome ſtinking rags? Smels he not of the Swine he kept? Could a man come neere him, without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his noſe? Would not a man be
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:260:234"/> ready to lay up his ſtomack, upon ſuch an imbracement? Certainly, a ſinner is a loathſome verminous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not onely clothed in rags, but in ſtinking and vile rags, <hi>Iſay</hi> 64. 6. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags.</hi> What then are our <hi>unrighteouſneſſes?</hi> What loathſome rags are they? And yet let a ſinner come to the Lord, and the Lord will fall upon his neck, will hug him, and imbrace him. <hi>Iſaac ſmelt the ſavour of Iacobs raiment, and he bleſſed him, Gen.</hi> 27. 27. That was a ſweet ſavour. <hi>The ſmell of my ſonne is as the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſſed:</hi> no wonder that <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſes him. But here is one in ſuch an unſavoury pickle, that when his Father ſhould <hi>ſmell the ſavour of his garments,</hi> one would have thought he ſhould have <hi>curſed him,</hi> becauſe his ſmell was as the ſmell of a Swine, as the ſmell of a Gaole. But yet for all that his Father claſpes him in his armes, and bleſſes him with an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty welcome. Mercy then, I ſee, is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:260:234"/> not ſqueamiſh, is not nice, and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but let a ſinner have beene what he will, let him be as filthy, as unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory as he can; yet if once he loath himſelfe, God will not loath him; if hee once come to God, God will claſpe him with the armes of mercy. The Prodigall comes to his Father, with the ſavour, and in the habit of a loathſome rogue, and yet his Father <hi>fals upon his neck.</hi> O the ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and aſtoniſhing mercies, and goodneſſe of God, to a ſinner that comes unto him. And will God thus imbrace a Prodigall in his loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rags, and will he not imbrace him much more afterwards, when he hath put the beſt robe upon him? Oh the welcome then that they ſhall finde with God, that have put on Chriſt, and are clothed with the ſweet ſmelling garment of their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, that have the whole rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe upon them!</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixthly, but yet behold a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:260:235"/> wonder than all the reſt. I ſee him <hi>kiſsing his ſon. And he kiſſed him.</hi> Who could have brooked to have imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a perſon in ſo filthy a pickle; much more, who could have broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to have <hi>kiſſed</hi> ſuch an one? What! <hi>kiſſe</hi> thoſe lips that had beene lately lapping in the Hogs trough! <hi>Kiſſe</hi> thoſe lips that had ſo often <hi>kiſſed</hi> thoſe baſe and baggage Harlots of his! <hi>Kiſſe</hi> him! A man would have thought he ſhould rather have <hi>kickt</hi> him, than have <hi>kist</hi> him: and yet his Father <hi>kiſſes</hi> him. There is a paſſage ſomewhat like this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4. <hi>Eſau ran to meet Iacob, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> A ſtrange, and a wonderfull thing, that he that had threatned to <hi>kill</hi> him, and came now upon that errand, to <hi>kill</hi> him and all his, that his heart ſhould ſo ſtrangely bee altered by God, that <hi>killing</hi> ſhould be turned into <hi>kiſsing.</hi> It was very ſtrange that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould <hi>kiſſe Iacob;</hi> but it is more ſtrange here, that this Father ſhould
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:260:235"/> 
                  <hi>kiſſe</hi> this Prodigall. It is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable thing in that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4. That over that word <hi>kiſſed,</hi> in the Hebrew Text, there be ſet three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pricks, or markes, to put the Reader in minde, that he ſhould obſerve this matter well, as a very ſtrang thing. Now how much more might three ſuch pricks, nay three times three ſuch markes be ſet over this word here, <hi>He kiſſed him!</hi> Here is a matter of greater wonder, worthy greater obſervation, that ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould <hi>kiſſe</hi> ſuch a ſon, in ſuch a filthy pickle. It had beene much if he might have <hi>kiſt</hi> his Fathers hand, but he gives him not his hand, but his mouth to <hi>kiſſe.</hi> Was it not much that Chriſt would ſuffer that ſinfull woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. who had defiled her lips w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> many an adulterous <hi>kiſſe,</hi> to <hi>kiſſe his feet;</hi> but Chriſt gives not his <hi>feet,</hi> but his <hi>mouth,</hi> his <hi>lips,</hi> to be <hi>kiſſed</hi> by beleeving, repenting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Let him kiſſe mee with the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> Behold then
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:260:236"/> the ineffable goodneſſe of God to all that come to him. Though this ſon a Prodigall, yet his Father <hi>kiſſes</hi> him, gives him a <hi>kiſſe,</hi> the ſeale and pledge of his pardon and remiſſion. See then, oh my ſoule, what here is to excite and ſtir up thy faith, and to quicken it mightily. Behold, God hath an <hi>eye of mercy,</hi> he ſees a farre off. Hee hath <hi>bowels of mercy;</hi> Hee had compaſſion. Hee hath <hi>feet of mercy;</hi> He ran to him. He hath <hi>armes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> He fell upon him, and imbraced him. He hath <hi>lips of mercy;</hi> And he kiſſed him. Wouldeſt thou not come to God, if he would <hi>looke</hi> upon thee? He will ſee thee whileſt <hi>yet a great way off.</hi> Wouldeſt thou not come, if God will compaſſionate thee? He will draw forth the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his compaſſions to thee. Wouldeſt thou not come to him, if he would <hi>meet thee?</hi> Behold, he will <hi>run</hi> to meet thee. Wouldeſt thou not come, if God would imbrace thee? Loe, he will <hi>fail upon thee,</hi> and claſpe
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:260:236"/> thee in the armes of his <hi>mercy.</hi> Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou not come if he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee? He will ſeale thy pardon with a <hi>kiſſe.</hi> Oh my ſoule, up, come to Chriſt, receive and imbrace him without any more adoe. Thus by conſidering GODS promiſes, and weighing his ſweet mercies in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> faith cannot but receive much life and quickning. So may a man doe with other like places, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereof the Word is full. This ſhall ſuffice for inſtance to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, and let us ſee how much the conſideration of the promiſes would conduce to the quickning of our faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is not enough for a man to have repented in his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, nor to have it renewed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſin ſince fallen into; but it is required that before the Sacrament, there be alwayes a freſh renewing of <hi>repentance.</hi> So oft as the Prieſts went into the Tabernacle, they waſht their hands and their feet, at every freſh
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:260:237"/> entrance, a freſh waſhing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 31, 32. <hi>When they went into the Tent of the Congregation, and when they came neere unto the Altar, they waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Lord commanded Moſes.</hi> So muſt it be here, there muſt be a freſh waſhing in the laver of repentance, before the receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that upon theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, though wee bee well waſhed before one Sacrament, yet before another it is a great deale of ſoile that our ſoules gather. Though wee waſh our hands well this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet becauſe a man is medling with this buſineſſe, and medling with that worke, it cannot bee but his hands will bee ſullied before next morning againe. Men have many occaſions of buſineſſe in the world, meet with many ſnares and tentations, have many ſlips, and treadings awry, and ſo contracting freſh pollutions there is need of freſh purgations. Wee deſire at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to have CHRIST make
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:260:237"/> a freſh entrance into our hearts, therefore there muſt bee a freſh trimming and dreſſing up of the houſe; as when wee looke for gheſts, though our houſes bee tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learably handſome already, yet we doe afreſh dreſſe up our houſes for their entertainment, and make them more than ordinarily hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; every roome is ſwept, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rubbed, ſtrewed, and garniſhed. How much more ſhould there be a freſh trimming, and dreſſing up of the roomes of our hearts, for the entertainment of ſo glorious a gheſt as the LORD CHRIST is. Looke as it is ſaid of Sathan in his kinde, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44, 45. <hi>That when he findes his houſe ſwept, and garniſhed, then hee enters and dwels there;</hi> ſo it is true of the LORD CHRIST in his kinde, that when he findes his <hi>houſe ſwept and garniſhed, then he enters and dwels there.</hi> He will not enter into, nor dwell in a ſluttiſh undreſt heart. Repentance renewed before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:260:238"/> it <hi>ſweeps</hi> and <hi>garniſhes</hi> the heart, and ſo fits it for Chriſts entrance. The entertainment wee ſhould give the Saints of God, ſhould be much more given to Chriſt himſelfe. How ſhould the Saints of God be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? ſee 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Deo convenienter,</hi> ſayes <hi>Beza.</hi> It is a phraſe hard to be engliſhed, <hi>Agreeably to God,</hi> as one would ſay. Chriſt is <hi>God,</hi> bleſſed for ever; and therefore when we entertaine him, we muſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment as beſeemes God. Then wee doe ſo entertaine him when the heart is ſwept and garniſhed. That is done by the freſh renewing of our repentance, when we come to receive him in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, when wee come to receive the Sacrament, wee come to renew our acquaintance with the Lord. Now what it is that helpes to bring us into acquaintance, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of that muſt renew our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. What is it that helpes
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:260:238"/> bring us into acquaintance with <hi>God?</hi> ſee <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21. 23. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelfe with him. If thou returne to the Almighty.</hi> Repentance a great meanes of acquaintance with God, and ſo renewing of repentance a great meanes to renew acquaintance with God. Since therefore in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is a renewing and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of our acquaintance with God, there muſt neceſſarily be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our repentance before the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the Scriptures ſpeake of a <hi>ſealing with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. Now as in Courts, there be ſome dayes that are called <hi>Sealing-dayes;</hi> ſo there be ſome ſpeciall <hi>ſealing-times</hi> and <hi>ſealing-dayes</hi> in this kinde. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are <hi>ſeales, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And Sacrament dayes are the <hi>ſealing dayes</hi> of the Court of Heaven. So that when a man comes to the Sacrament he comes to be ſealed. And therefore
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:260:239"/> in this regard there muſt be a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance before the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament. Otherwiſe a man is not ſealeable, not capable of the ſeale and the impreſſion of it. Hard wax will not receive the print of the ſeale. Before we put the ſeale to the wax, wee firſt melt the wax, or warme, and ſo ſoften it at the fire, and ſo prepare it for a capacity of the ſeales impreſſion. So when the heart is melted and is ſoftned, then it is fit to take the ſeale of the Spirit in the uſe of the ſeale in the Sacrament. Now the renewing of repentance before the Sacrament, is a melting, a warming, and a ſoftning of the heart, and a fitting it for the ſeale. So needfull then and requiſite, as the melting or ſoftning of the wax is before ſealing, ſo needfull is the renewing of repentance before the Sacrament. Many come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and there is no print or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made in their heart, there is no appearance of any ſeale; let ſuch
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:260:239"/> conſider whether they did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſoftning of their hearts by not renewing their repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein ſtands this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of repentance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, in a freſh examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hearts, to finde out our ſinnes and corruptions. We ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we muſt examine our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that is not all, there muſt bee an examination of our ſelves for our ſins. That <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> is to be done in our renewed repentance before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Better we our ſelves ſearch and make inquiry, before we goe to the Sacrament, than God ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after our iniquities, and make a ſearch after our ſins at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Iob</hi> complaines, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 6. <hi>That God enquired after his iniquity, and ſearched after his ſin.</hi> That is a ſore thing. We can looke for no better at the Sacrament, if we have not done it before we come thither.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, in a ſolemne <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:260:240"/> of ſin, with deepe <hi>humiliation</hi> for them. This confeſſion, let it be full, and bring out thy ſins, as they tooke the Veſſels of the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 34. <hi>By number</hi> and by <hi>weight.</hi> By number firſt. Charge thy ſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially with all the ſins thou canſt recall. So let thy confeſſion be full in regard of <hi>enumeration, Lev.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>All their iniquities, all their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Then by weight; ſo let thy confeſſions be full in regard of <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> make them as great and as foule in their natures and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as thou canſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40. 12. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. And thus haply may we underſtand that place, <hi>Levit</hi> 16. 21. <hi>He ſhall confeſſe all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and all their tranſgreſsions in all their ſins:</hi> not only <hi>their ſins,</hi> but <hi>all their transgreſsions in their ſinnes;</hi> that is, hee ſhall not onely confeſſe their ſins, but he ſhall aggravate their ſins, by laying open how many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions were wrapped up in their ſeverall ſinnes, and how many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:260:240"/> were in the ſeverall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their ſins. The laden ſoul is called to come to Chriſt, is promiſed eaſe and refreſhment: and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made good in the uſe of the Sacrament. As therefore we would bee in the number of thoſe whom Chriſt cals, and to whom he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eaſe and refreſhment; yea, as we would have this eaſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Sacrament, ſo come with laden ſoules as much as we can. The <hi>heavier</hi> and the <hi>weightier</hi> wee make our ſins in our confeſſions, the likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are to <hi>lade</hi> us. And let thy confeſſions be with deepe humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let them bee <hi>dolorous confeſsions</hi> with griefe and ſorrow for ſin, and from a ſight and ſenſe of it. Labour to ſee and feele thy ſin, and ſight and ſenſe of it will worke ſorrow for it. Sight helpes to ſorrow. As in that caſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 51. <hi>Mine eye affects mine heart:</hi> ſo is it true in the ſight of ſin: the eye that ſees ſin affects the heart, feeling of ſin helpes to ſorrow. The
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:260:241"/> weight of it felt, will bring the heart to ſorrow in confeſſion. <hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was with ſorrow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 18. <hi>I will declare,</hi> that is, confeſſe mine iniquity. But how ſhall his confeſſion be qualified? <hi>I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi> How comes he by his ſorrow? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that, Verſ. 4. <hi>For mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are gone over mine head, as an hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vie burthen; they are too heavie for me.</hi> What can make the heart more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie than when it feeles the heavineſſe and weight of ſin? So ſhould a man carry himſelfe in his confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did in that confeſſion of his, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> Make thy confeſſions before the Sacrament, <hi>bemoaning</hi> confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let our confeſſions be ever ſo long and ſo large, ever ſo exact and particular, yet if done without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, it is but an <hi>hiſtoricall</hi> confeſſion. It is all one, as if a man ſhould come and tell God a Story, or a long Tale of his ſins. God doth not require
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:260:241"/> our confeſſions before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to tell him that which hee knowes not; he knowes our ſins bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our ſelves, but that in our confeſſions wee ſhould have our hearts ſorrowfully affected for them. Be ſure therefore before thou come to the Sacrament, to renew thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in confeſſion: one ſweet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſhalt thou have by it amongſt others, and that is this; Our ſelfe-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations in our confeſſions will be a prevention, and a diſappointment of Satans accuſations againſt us. The Divell, even at the Sacrament, will bee laying in againſt us; it is good therefore to take a courſe to defeat him. He will be pleading againſt a man, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſhall this man be welcome to thy Table? Shall he receive the benefit of thine Ordinance? He hath done thus and thus; I can lay to his charge theſe and theſe ſins. Thus by his accuſations will he ſeek to put in a bar againſt a bleſſing upon us. Now when a man before the Sacrament
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:260:242"/> renewes his repentance, and hath in his confeſſions brought in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations <note place="margin">Praeventus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus in accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, ultra nos accuſare non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit. Et ſi ipſi noſtri ſimus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatores proficit nobis ad ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſi vero ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectemus ut a Diabolo accuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, accuſatio illa nobis cedit ad poenam. Orig. <hi>Hom.</hi> 3. <hi>in Levit.</hi>
                  </note> againſt himſelfe, Satan is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: for then wee doe, as I may ſay, furniſh the <hi>Lord</hi> with an anſwer to ſtop Satans mouth: for then will the <hi>Lord</hi> be ready to anſwer for us, Why Satan, thou accuſeſt this man of nothing, whereof he hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to the full, accuſed himſelfe; he himſelfe hath accuſed himſelfe of all this already. Thou commeſt too late, all thine accuſations ſhall be no barre to my bleſſing. The elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers noſe ſwels at his Fathers kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and goodneſſe to his prodigall brother, and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 30. He rips up all his courſes, and throws the filth of them in his face, that hee was one that had devoured his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>living, and had ſpent it among Harlots.</hi> And this hee doth now whileſt they are at the Feaſt, at the fatted Calfe, and good cheere. Yet all this doth the prodigall no hurt, the muſick ceaſes not, the Feaſt is not
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:260:242"/> broken off, nor he thruſt out of dores againe. And how comes it about that all this did him no hurt? Becauſe the prodigall had prevented his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he himſelfe had accuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the full in his confeſſions, when he came to his Father: and ſo by his owne confeſſion, had tooke out the ſting and poiſon of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers malicious accuſation. So that his brother comes too late now, the Feaſt and the merriment goe on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe. So will the Divell bee ſnarling againſt, and picking quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels againſt men, even in the Feaſt time; but he comes too late to doe them hurt, if they themſelves have firſt put in the bils of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditements againſt themſelves in their confeſſions before their comming to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, in <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneing</hi> our ſelves. The duty inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. eſpecially in judging our ſelves unworthy the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and honour of comming to the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:260:243"/> Lords Table. <hi>Lord, I am not worthy,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Centurion, that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roofe.</hi> So ſhould we acknowledge our utter unworthineſſe of comming under the roofe of <hi>Gods</hi> houſe, much more of comming to his Table. We ſhould judge our ſelves unworthy of ſuch fellowſhip with God. And the more unworthy we judge our ſelves, the worthier gheſts ſhall we be in the <hi>Lords</hi> acceptance. And thus muſt our faith and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance bee renewed, before our comming to the <hi>Lords Table.</hi>

This is the <hi>due Order</hi> that God requires; hee that comes thus, comes in due Order. So ſhould men come to the Sacrament, as Chriſt to that Paſſeover, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 15. <hi>With deſire have I deſired to eat this Paſſeover with you:</hi> that is, I have exceedingly, earneſtly, and heartily deſired to eat it with you; not deſired it, but <hi>deſired it with deſire.</hi> Single de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires will not ſerve the turne, but a man muſt come with <hi>deſiring deſires,</hi> with double deſires, with earneſt and ſtrong deſires, that will ſeek <hi>God</hi> after the due Order. God muſt be ſought after the ſame <hi>order</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as in other his Ordinances. After this Order muſt GOD bee ſought in all his Ordinances, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 63. 1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeeke thee.</hi> There is the duty of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:260:244"/> He will ſeeke God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in his Word, Worſhip, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, &amp;c. Well, but after what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will he ſeeke him? <hi>After the due Order.</hi> How is that? with longing, thirſting, enlarged deſires of ſpirit, <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for thee, my fleſh lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for thee.</hi> Then comes a man to Gods Ordinances, and ſo to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in due Order, when hee comes with theſe thirſting, longing deſires. So ſhould a man come to the Sacrament, as an hungry man comes to his meat, as a thirſty man to his drinke. A man that is hungry, is not only willing to eat, a man that is thirſty, is not onely willing to drinke, but he ſtrongly longs after his meat, and drinke; with deſire he deſires it, and thinks it very long till he have it. In the Sacrament there is not only food, but a Feaſt, ſuch a Feaſt as that, <hi>Iſay</hi> 25. 6. If an hungry man will long after <hi>food,</hi> what will he doe after a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> after a <hi>Feaſt</hi> of choice dainties? How needfull this
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:260:244"/> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, appeares by theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, onely ſuch are invited to the Sacrament, as are invited to come to Chriſt: for what come they to the Sacrament for, but to come to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now they onely are invited to come to Chriſt, and they onely are fit to come to Chriſt, that doe hunger and thirſt after him with inlarged deſires, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 17. So muſt they be qualified that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, and ſo muſt they bee qualified alſo that will receive him in the Sacrament. It is cheerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament, when a man knowes he ſhall be welcome. He ſhall be ſure to be welcome that is invited, and the deſiring, hungry, thirſty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ſpirit, is undoubtedly invited.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, to ſuch onely is the end of the Sacrament made good. As ſuch are only invited, ſo ſuch are onely fed and feaſted. What come we to the Sacrament for? Come we not to be made partakers of the good things there prepared for us? God,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:260:245"/> he prepares, and <hi>makes ready</hi> for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 4. And when we come, we come to eat the good things GOD hath prepared, and made ready for us. Now if wee would eat thoſe things which GOD hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, we muſt come prepared with hunger, thirſt, and deſires after theſe things. And when we come thus qualified, wee ſhall bee ſure to meet with a bleſſing, and to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which God hath prepared. God that would have men <hi>deale their bread to the hungry, Iſay,</hi> 58. 7. will certainly himſelfe much more deale bread to an hungry ſoule, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107. 9. <hi>For he ſatisfieth the longing ſoule, and fils the hungry with goodneſſe.</hi> Do we not come to the Sacrament to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to be ſatisfied? would we not be loth to be ſent away lanke and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? They that come with <hi>longing ſoules,</hi> ſhall be ſent away with <hi>ſatisfied ſoules. Iſay</hi> 44. 3. <hi>I will powre water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that is thirsty, and flouds upon the drie ground.</hi> Not <hi>drop,</hi> but <hi>powre,</hi>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:260:245"/> not a <hi>ſhowre,</hi> but a <hi>floud.</hi> So liberally God anſwers hungring and enlarged deſires. There is a phraſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 10. <hi>If thou draw out thy ſoule to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.</hi> When men come hungry to his Ordinance, God will <hi>draw out his ſoule</hi> to ſatisfie them. We ſhall ſee it made good in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 63. 1. <hi>My ſoule thirſteth, my fleſh longeth.</hi> What came of it? Did hee long in vaine? Did hee loſe his longing? No: but Verſe 5. <hi>My ſoule ſhall bee ſatisfied as with morrow and fatneſſe, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lips.</hi> So aboundantly ſhould his heart be ſatisfied and cheered, with the fat and ſweet of GODS Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that hee ſhould breake out into the praiſes of GOD, What an excellent thing is it to taſte the marrow and fat of Gods Ordinances! much more to feed on it! much more to feed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fulneſſe and ſatisfaction! whoſe teeth would not water after ſuch curious delicates? Bring longing,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:260:246"/> hungry enlarged deſires, and fat, and marrow ſhall be our portion. For herein hath ſpirituall hunger an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above bodily. Bodily hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a man may hunger withall, and yet his hunger helpes him to no meat nor ſatisfaction: But ſpirituall hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doth, as having the promiſe of ſatisfaction. Chriſt out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions will liberally releeve all hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <note place="margin">Ecce, pauper ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio ad te divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, miſer ad miſericordem, ne recedam vac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſts compaſſions
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:260:246"/> will not ſuffer him to ſend away an hungry ſoule faſting. Alas, he knowes it would faint if it ſhould come emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and goe away empty, if it ſhould come hungry, and goe away hungry.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the more ſtrength in our deſires, the more hunger in our ſpirits, the more aboundant and the more plentifull ſatisfaction. The more our hearts are inlarged in our deſires, the more Gods hand will be inlarged in his bounty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> God hath an <hi>open hand,</hi> for all that have an <hi>open mouth.</hi> God hath an hand <hi>wide open,</hi> for ſuch as have their mouthes <hi>wide open.</hi> A mouth wide opened, ſhall be a mouth full filled. A wide mouth ſhall be a full mouth. God will inlarge himſelfe to all that come to him with inlarged hearts. Gods admeaſurements of grace and ſpirituall good, are ſuitable to mens inlargements and dilations of their ſpirits. Three things fit a Veſſell to receive a great meaſure of liquor.
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:260:247"/> 1. When it is of <hi>large capacity.</hi> A ſmall Veſſell may be filled, but yet a ſmall Veſſell cannot have ſo much infuſed into it, as a Veſſell that is of larger capacity. The larger the bucket is that is let downe into the Well, the more water it brings up. 2. When it is an <hi>open Veſſell.</hi> Though a Veſſell be of ſufficient capacity, yet if the <hi>Veſſell bee ſhut,</hi> and the mouth of it cloſed up, though it be throwne into the Sea where there is water enough, yet it fils not. 3. When it is <hi>wide open.</hi> Though the mouth of a <hi>Veſſell be open,</hi> yet if it be not <hi>wide open,</hi> it doth not fill ſo readily. Take a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or a narrow-mouth'd Glaſſe, and dowſe it under the water, and yet it may bee pulled up againe with little or no water in it, though it bee of great capacity, becauſe the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mouth hinders the ready and quick paſſage of water into it. A <hi>wide-mouth'd Veſſell,</hi> as a Paile or Bucket, is no ſooner under water, but it is inſtantly filled, becauſe the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:260:247"/> mouth of the Veſſell is <hi>wide</hi> and <hi>broade.</hi> So when we come to Gods Ordinances, to the Sacrament, wee ſhould come ſo as to be filled, wee ſhould come to get as liberall largeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as poſſibly we can. The way to doe that, is to have our hearts Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of competent <hi>capacity,</hi> to have them <hi>opened,</hi> to have them <hi>wide ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> The way to doe theſe things, is to have our hearts inlarged with hungring and longing deſires. Such enlarged deſires <hi>open the mouth,</hi> &amp; <hi>open it wide;</hi> and when our mouthes are opened, God will <hi>open</hi> his hand, his <hi>filling</hi> hand. As therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have the <hi>Lord</hi> fill our mouthes when we come to the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> ſo let us get our mouthes <hi>wide open.</hi> When wee come to the Sacrament, why come wee? Is it not that wee may eat our <hi>fill</hi> of Chriſts body, and drink our <hi>fill</hi> of his bloud? Is it not that we may go from the <hi>Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as Chriſt went from <hi>Iordan, full of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> As we deſire to
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:260:248"/> have <hi>full mouthes,</hi> ſo let us bring <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wide opened mouthes.</hi> When men come to the Sacrament with hearts enlarged, and hungring deſires, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give ſuch a Commandement to the Sacrament, as he did to thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants concerning the water-pots, and it ſhall doe as they did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto them, fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</hi> So in this caſe will Chriſt ſay, Loe, here be men come with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged hearts, with earneſt and ſtrong deſires, I ſee they have <hi>opened</hi> their <hi>mouthes wide;</hi> fill them with my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with my vertues, and efficacies, fill them with ſpirituall ſtrength againſt their corruptions, fill them with power to walke in obedience: and upon this command of Chriſt, the Sacrament ſhall empty it ſelfe with an aboundant bleſſing upon their ſoules, yea, it ſhall <hi>fill them up to the brim.</hi> What an happy thing is it to be <hi>full, brim-full</hi> of Chriſt? A mouth wide open, will be a meanes
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:260:248"/> to fill the heart full, <hi>brimme full</hi> of Chriſt. That man comes happily to the Sacrament indeed, that can ſay after his being at the Sacrament, as they did in that caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 2, 3. <hi>Then was our mouth filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our tongue with ſinging. The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</hi> Now, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou be able after a Sacrament to ſay, When I was at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then was my <hi>mouth filled</hi> with laughter, my <hi>tongue</hi> with ſignging, and mine <hi>heart</hi> with ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy; The <hi>Lord</hi> hath done great things for me, whereof I am glad. Wouldeſt thou after a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be able thus to ſay? Why then when thou goeſt to the Sacrament, <hi>Open thy mouth,</hi> and <hi>open thy mouth wide,</hi> and GOD will <hi>fill</hi> thy <hi>mouth</hi> with laughter, and thine <hi>heart</hi> with ſpirituall joy. It is true, that a great many goe from the Sacrament, and their mouthes are not filled with laughter, but with complaints, with
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:260:249"/> ſad complaints of the little good they receive at the Sacrament. Many come from the Sacrament with emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mouthes, empty hearts? And what may the reaſon of it be? Is not God as bountifull as he was wont to be? Yes ſurely: he is the ſame God that ever, his hand is not ſhortned; but the very reaſon is, that men come with <hi>ſhut mouthes,</hi> or at leſt, with their mouthes but <hi>narrowly opened;</hi> and <hi>ſhut mouthes,</hi> and <hi>narrow mouthes,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>empty mouthes.</hi> Wee <hi>open</hi> not, therfore <hi>God fils</hi> not; we <hi>open</hi> not <hi>wide,</hi> therefore God <hi>fils</hi> not <hi>full.</hi> Is the Sea empty, becauſe a ſtopt Veſſell is not filled when throwne into it? Is there no water in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe a narrow mouth'd Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell brings up ſo little? Surely there is a ſufficiency of all ſpirituall good, in Chriſt a <hi>fulneſſe of bleſsing</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance: all the fault is in our own indiſpoſition, we come w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dead, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, formall, narrow, ſtraight, and cloſed hearts, and that is the very
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:260:249"/> bane of the buſineſſes, See how Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11, 12. <hi>O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is inlarged, yee are not ſtraitned in us, but yee are ſtraitned in your owne bowels.</hi> So ſayes Chriſt: O ye ſons of men, mine hand is full, mine hand, and mine heart is open unto you, mine Ordinance in the Sacrament is open unto you; that is not ſtraitned in its owne nature, but it is ready to powre out it ſelfe to you. What is the matter then that ye go away ſo empty mouthed? ye are <hi>straitned</hi> in your owne <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> you have not <hi>opened mouthes,</hi> nor <hi>inlarged hearts.</hi> Certainly, if men could come to the Sacrament, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did to that ſervice of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1. it would be farre otherwiſe with us; <hi>Mine heart,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>is inlarged over mine enemies.</hi> So if we could ſay, mine heart is inlarged towards my Saviour, my deſires, and hunger is inlarged after him, we ſhold then finde Gods hand ſuitably inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to our hearts.</p>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:260:250"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhould a man get his <hi>mouth wide opened,</hi> how ſhould he get his deſires thus inlarged after Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, get a ſenſe and a ſight of Chriſts worth, and thine owne wants. Offer meat and drinke to a man that is full, and he will not open his mouth to receive it, <hi>The full deſpiſes the honey-combe;</hi> but let a man alone till his ſtomack be empty, and when once he feeles the pinches and twitches of emptineſſe, and when once he feeles the want of meat and drinke, and ſo begins to prize the worth of it, he will quickly open his mouth, and open it wide, readily, and greedily too, if food be preſented to him. Such a ſenſe of the want and the worth of Chriſt, would open our mouth wide indeed. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſhuts up our mouthes as our ſenſeleſſeneſſe of our wants, and the worth of Chriſt. The pincht Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall can thinke upon, and deſire the bread in his Fathers houſe. Labour
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:260:250"/> therefore to affect thine heart with the ſenſe of thy want of Chriſt; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to feele how miſerable thou art without him; labour to ſee his riches, excellencies, and all his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencies, theſe things would be as keyes to unlock and open our ſhut mouthes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, labour in private, before you come to the Sacrament, by your owne endeavours, to ſtretch and widen your mouthes. Strive by much prayer to get thine heart inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Inlargements of the heart in private prayer, will fit the heart for inlargement in the Sacrament. One duty affords contribution to another, and one duty diſpoſes to another. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have thine heart inlarged by private meditations and workings upon the promiſes. This is that which is the miſchiefe of all, Men put off the worke of opening their mouthes, till in a manner they be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their mouthes to receive the Elements, and having the work then
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:260:251"/> to doe, they are ſo ſhut up in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deadneſſe, that they cannot by any meanes open their mouthes at all. The heart will not on a ſudden, and at a beck, be brought into a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall frame; it is a worke that will ask time and paines. The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpirituall mouth, and the widening of it, is not ſo ſoone, nor ſo eaſily done, as the opening of the bodily mouth. It is a worke that muſt bee done gradually, and with ſome ſtriving before hand. It will aske much prayer. The ſame God that muſt fill them, it is even he that muſt open them, and therefore hee muſt be ſought to earneſtly. It will aske much meditation and ſtrugling in private. A man that would make a bladder capacious to hold ſpices, he blowes it, and rubs it, and blowes and rubs it many times over, and all to make it the larger. If a man were promiſed, that on ſuch a day hee ſhould have as much money as his purſe would hold, how would hee
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:260:251"/> every day before be ſtretching, and reaching his purſe, that by little and little hee might ſtretch it to ſuch a bigneſſe and capacity, that it might receive a great ſumme. If therefore thou wouldeſt have thy heart capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and large at the Sacrament, bee often before the Sacrament ſtrugling with thine owne heart, and get it well inlarged by the ſerious uſe of private helpes. Our cuſtomary formality undoes us. When we ſhould be eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, then have wee our mouthes to open. How can they eat and drinke, whoſe mouthes are not opened? It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>God gave So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> largeneſſe of heart, <hi>as the ſand that is on the Sea ſhoare.</hi> It is ſaid of Hell, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>that Hell hath</hi> enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>her ſelfe, and</hi> opened her mouth <hi>without meaſure.</hi> Now if it were thus with our hearts, that we had <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, as the ſand on the Sea ſhore,</hi> if our hearts were <hi>inlarged,</hi> and our <hi>mouthes opened without meaſure,</hi>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:260:252"/> yet were there aboundantly enough in Chriſt to fill our hearts, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the hungring deſires of our ſoules: our deſires cannot exceed Chriſts riches, nor Gods bounty, he is able to give above all that we <hi>can aske or thinke:</hi> and therefore let us labour with all our might, for a diſtention, and a dilation of our hearts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſtretch, and widen them to the utmoſt we poſſibly can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Men ſeeme generally to have theſe inlarged deſires, this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt; for how deſirous doe men ſeeme to be to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and how wondrous ill would they take it to be kept back?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be <hi>falſe hungers,</hi> and <hi>falſe thirſts, falſe deſires.</hi> 1. Firſt, there is a deſire that comes from <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>faſhion.</hi> It is the cuſtome of the Time, or the cuſtome of the Towne, and by any meanes they will bee neighbour-like; and becauſe others go to the Sacrament, they muſt needs go too. It is not any deſire of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:260:252"/> nor any hungring after him in his Ordinance, that drawes them on, but only a deſire to doe as others doe. You ſhall ſee many deſire to go to a Feaſt, whither they ſee all their neighbours go, and will take it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ill, if they be not invited; not becauſe they want a meales meat, or becauſe they greatly care for the cheere, but becauſe the reſt of their neighbours go, and it would be ſome diſgrace to them to bee left out; and therefore are very deſirous to goe, though they weigh not the cheere a whit, when they come there. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is a deſire that comes from ſuperſtition. Many have a ſtrong conceit, That the very deed doing, what ever they be that do it, and how ever they doe it, will work wonders with them. They are perſwaded, that if they do but receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhall receive ſome good thing, though they know no more than the poſt, what good thing it is that is to be received. This is a
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:260:253"/> 
                  <hi>ſuperſtitious thirst.</hi> 3. Thirdly, there is a <hi>true thirſt,</hi> and a <hi>right hunger</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And this is diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from the other by theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, by the <hi>object</hi> of it, for it is directly carried after Chriſt, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and communion with him, and fruition of him and his benefits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>My ſoule panteth after thee, O God, my ſoule thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God?</hi> This neither doe ignorant nor ſuperſtitious perſons doe. Experience proves it, for when they are queſtioned withall what makes them deſirous to come to the Sacrament, either they can give no reaſon why they deſire to come, or elſe never give any ſuch reaſon as this. Their deſires, at the beſt, are but after the worke and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, beyond which they never looke.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, by the <hi>grounds</hi> of it: for the grounds of true deſires, 1. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:260:253"/> a ſenſe of the want of Chriſt, a <hi>ſelfe-emptineſſe.</hi> Want of drinke makes men thirſt, want of meat makes men hunger. So true deſires come from the ſenſe of a mans owne wants and emptineſſe, which can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee ſupplied, and ſatisfied by Chriſt. 2. Or elſe from the ſenſe of former ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe of Chriſt in the uſe of the Ordinance. A man hath formerly received the Sacrament, and in the uſe of it hath found aboundance of ſweetneſſe in communion with CHRIST, hath found pardon ſealed, faith ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hath found his heart inlivened, and inlarged, hath gotten ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt his luſts, ſome ſtrength unto obedience: and having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received ſome good by it, this quickens and ſtirres up his deſires, and makes them the more vehement after Chriſt and his Ordinance. But with ignorant and ſuperſtitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is not ſo. It is neither a ſenſe of preſent wants, nor feeling of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:260:254"/> former benefit that moves their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, by the <hi>qualities</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of it. They are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, an holy kinde of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the want of the Ordinance. A man in bodily hunger and thirſt, growes impatient in caſe of delay, thinkes every minute ſeven, till hee come where he may have that which will ſatisfie. True deſires, ſpecially in caſe of delay, thinke long, till they be at the Ordinance where Chriſt is to be had. It is not once in a yeere will ſerve his turne. An hungry man eats oft, a thirſty man drinkes oft, and thinkes long till he comes to his meat, and drink. It is ſo here, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>My ſoule thirſteth, when ſhall I come?</hi> Not ſo with ignorant, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and ſuperſtitious ones. Let all be but agreed to ſtay from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and once in a yeere will richly ſuffice them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, nothing quiets the heart, nor can ſtill the craving deſires
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:260:254"/> of it, but injoyment of Chriſt in his Ordinance. When a man is heartily hungry, and thirſty, nothing ſatisfies him but meat and drinke. Give him what elſe you will, yet ſtill he craves meate and drink. So give a man what you will, that deſires Chriſt in the Ordinance, yet his ſoule is not quiet and ſatisfied. Give him the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet if hee have not Chriſt in the Ordinance, his deſires are not at quiet. Formality, and ſuperſtition, let them but do the outward worke, let them but receive the outward Elements, though they receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all elſe, yet they are well a-payd, and their ſpirits highly well contented. They thinke themſelves as well as a Sacrament can make them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, great and ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the uſe of the Ordinance. What ſweet contentment doth an hungry man finde in eating his meat, in drinking his drinke, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>When hee had drunke, his ſpirit came</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:260:255"/> 
                  <hi>againe and he revived, Prov.</hi> 25. 25. <hi>As cold waters to a thirsty ſoule, ſo is good newes from a far Country.</hi> The Proverbe implies a great deale of contentment, that a thirſty man takes in drinking cold waters. No ſuch ſweet findes formality, or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the uſe of the Sacrament. And ſo much may ſuffice for this fourth thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The fifth thing to bee done in actuall preparation is, <hi>To raiſe up in our ſelves,</hi> and to come with a <hi>ſtrong expectation of the benefits to bee received in the Sacrament.</hi> There be excellent and precious things to bee received in the Sacrament. As in the inſtitution we have a commandement to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drinke, Take</hi> and <hi>eat:</hi> ſo we have a promiſe from Chriſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things to be diſpenſed in this Ordinance. <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>eat:</hi> why, what if we take and eat? what ſhall we take, and what ſhall we eat? What is it that is to be had in the uſe of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? <hi>This is my body. Drinke ye</hi>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:260:255"/> 
                  <hi>all of this;</hi> What ſhall wee drinke? <hi>This is my bloud.</hi> So then Chriſt in the inſtitution of this Sacrament, hath promiſed that worthy receivers ſhall eat his body, ſhall drinke his bloud. In the Sacrament Chriſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his body to be eaten, and his bloud to be drunke; and promiſes that he will give thoſe things to the faithfull receiver. Now then when we come to the Sacrament, we ſhould come with an expectation to have theſe promiſes made good, we ſhould come with a full account to receive theſe things promiſed. When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> went up to the Temple, the Creeple asking an almes of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 4. they faſtning their eyes on him, ſaid unto him, <hi>looke on us.</hi> And the Text ſayes, <hi>hee gave heed unto them, expecting to receive ſomething of them.</hi> And his expectation was not diſappointed, <hi>he received ſomething,</hi> and a better thing than he expected. When we come to the Sacrament, we ſhould <hi>give good heed</hi> to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:260:256"/> promiſes, and ſhould have a fixed eye upon them, <hi>expecting to receive ſomething from them,</hi> and from the Ordinance. And ſurely ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ours ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. If we come with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, God would never ſend us away without ſatisfaction in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. We never finde any that came to Chriſt to be healed, or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in any kinde, but they came to him with a ſtrong expectation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit they came for. If a Leper came, he came with <hi>expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of cleanſing. If a blind man came, he came with <hi>expectation</hi> of his ſight. If a lame man came, he came with <hi>expectation</hi> of the reſtitution of his limbs. And we never reade in all the Goſpell, that ever any man that came with an expectation of any good from him, that was turned away with his expectation deceived. <hi>If I have cauſed the eyes of the widdow to faile,</hi> ſayes <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 31. 16. Poore Widowes, that were oppreſſed and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:260:256"/> wronged by others, or that were in want, and needed ſuccour, they came to <hi>Iob,</hi> and they came to him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that he would aſſuredly pleaſure them. Their eyes were to <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> ſeeing that they came to him with ſuch an expectation, he by no meanes would cauſe the <hi>expecting</hi> eyes of the Widow to <hi>faile.</hi> If we would ſo come to the Sacrament with our eyes to Chriſt, and to his promiſes, expecting his making good his promiſes to us, hee would not cauſe our eyes to faile. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolve, Chriſt hath promiſed to give in the Sacrament his body and his bloud, to give the benefits of his death, he hath promiſed to ſeale pardon, to manifeſt himſelfe, to give power againſt luſts, &amp;c. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now go to this Ordinance, with a particular expectation of ſuch and ſuch a particular bleſſing as my ſoule ſtands in need of. And moſt ſure it is, that the want of this duty proves very prejudiciall to us. How come
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:260:257"/> many from the Sacrament without any benefit, or good at all. How fals it out ſo? They have as much as they expected; as they went <hi>expecting</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo they come away <hi>receiving</hi> nothing. God will not drop downe his bleſſings upon oſcitant and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearts. We our ſelves will not give unto others where wee know there is no ſuch thing expected from us.</p>

And what bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of greater weight, what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein we ſtand ſo much in need of God, and his helpe, as in the worthy receiving of the Sacrament? If common and ordinary buſineſſe muſt not be medled withall without prayer for direction and bleſſing, how much leſſe ſhould this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of receiving the Sacrament? How needfull a duty this is will thus appeare:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, this duty neglected, it will caſt a dampe upon all other our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. This failing in the laſt act, will marre all that hitherto wee have done, neither can a bleſſing be
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:260:258"/> expected upon all the reſt, in the want of this. We know <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart are in man, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the mouth is from the Lord.</hi> The meaning of it is, that though a man have ſtudied hard, and have well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and prepared himſelfe what to ſay, yet he hath need of Gods help, to deliver the thoughts of his mind, and that a man cannot <hi>bring forth</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions without the obſtetrication of Gods aſſiſtance. A Miniſter, when he is to preach, ſpends time in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the work; now when he is thus prepared, yet he needs the helpe of God for a <hi>doore of utterance.</hi> Is it not therefore exceeding neceſſary for a Miniſter, though he have ever ſo well prepared himſelfe by ſtudy, to ſeeke to God by prayer, <hi>that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance may be given unto him, that he may open his mouth,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to be prayed for, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 19. Though a man by ſtudy be well and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided, yet if a man, without
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:260:258"/> prayer to GOD for his aſſiſtance, ſhould up into the Pulpit, might not ſuch an one feare that his mouth might be ſtopt, and God ſhould ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence him in the Pulpit? Or could he looke at leſt that his tongue ſhould ſo ſpeake, as that the preparations of his heart ſhould go to the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? For al a Miniſters preparations, notwithſtanding he ſtands in need of Gods ſpeciall aſſiſtance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it neerely concernes him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his preparations to ſeeke to God by prayer, for that helpe and aſſiſtance of his. Iuſt ſo it is in the caſe of the Sacrament. The prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the heart are in man, but yet ability and power to do the work at the Sacrament, is from the Lord; ſo that if God helpe not, and aſſiſt not, all preparations come to little. And it cannot be expected that God ſhould helpe, when he is neglected and not ſought to, and intreated to helpe. We need Gods helpe in all things, but ſpecially in holy duties.
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:260:259"/> What was the bearing of the Ark on the Prieſts ſhoulders to the receiving of the Sacrament? One would think there ſhould have needed no ſuch ſpeciall help to that work of bearing the Arke, beſides the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gods providence. And yet it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>That God helped the Levites that bare the Arke:</hi> yea, it was ſuch ſpeciall helpe, that they offered ſacrifices upon it. And if they needed the helpe of GOD to beare the Arke of the Lord; how much more do we need the helpe of God in this ſolemne action and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of receiving the Sacrament? And if ſuch need of helpe, is there not then as much need of prayer? Will helpe come from God without prayer? Will the Lord helpe us if we ſeeke not for his helpe? nothing leſſe. Nay, ſo farre from helping us, that we may rather feare he will curſe our performances. For upon our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, before ſpecified, to come to the Sacrament without ſpeciall
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:260:259"/> ſeeking God in prayer, what is it better than a truſting in our ſelves, and in our preparations? Aſſuredly God will blaſt all ſelfe-confidences, and all confidences in our owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. Therefore never thinke thy ſelfe duly prepared, till to all the reſt thou haſt joyned ſolemne and earneſt ſeeking of God by prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, it ſhould bee a mans great care, both to <hi>ſanctifie himſelfe</hi> to the Ordinance, and to have the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ſanctified</hi> to him. <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 6. to the Levites. Now prayer is the way to doe both. It ſanctifies us to the Ordinance, and the Ordinance to us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>All things are ſanctified by the word and prayer.</hi> All things, both <hi>perſons</hi> to the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> to the <hi>perſons,</hi> not only meats and drinkes, but Ordinances, Sacraments are ſanctified to our uſes by prayer. Where prayer is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither is the perſon ſanctified to the Ordinance, nor the Ordinance to the perſon.</p>

                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:260:260"/> 3 Thirdly, what an happy and a joyfull thing is it, when a man comes to the Sacrament, and it ſhall as it were ſay to a man, as <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Brother Saul, the Lord hath ſent me unto thee, that thou mightſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So when the Sacrament ſhall come with ſuch commiſſion to us, how bleſſed a thing is it? The Lord hath ſent mee unto thee, that thou mayeſt receive comfort, and <hi>be filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now there is a courſe to be taken, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may bee ſent with ſuch a Commiſſion. But what may that courſe be? Doe as <hi>Saul</hi> did, Verſ. 11. <hi>Ananias, goe inquire for Saul, &amp;c. for behold he prayes. Saul</hi> was <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> hard, and then when he is at prayer, before <hi>Ananias</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, then God gives this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Go Ananias,</hi> go thy wayes to <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>let him be filled with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, for behold he prayes.</hi> So if men before the Sacrament would
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:260:260"/> ſpend time in prayer, and be earneſt in ſeeking God, God would give a Commiſſion and a charge unto his Ordinance, Go and be effectuall and powerfull to ſuch a man, be a meanes to fill him with the Holy Ghoſt, for <hi>behold he prayes;</hi> and hath before his comming to my Table ſpent much time in prayer. It was at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts baptiſme that <hi>Chriſts</hi> prayer <hi>opened Heaven</hi> and brought downe the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Luke</hi> 3. 21, 22. And there is no queſtion, but our prayers at the Lords Supper, would the more eaſily and readily <hi>open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and bring downe the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> if we did but begin the work at home in private prayer by our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe conſiderations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us bee ſtirred up to beſtow much time in private prayer by our ſelves, before our comming to the Sacrament. Doe in this caſe as the Prophet ſpeaks in that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Every family apart, their wives apart.</hi> We muſt not only pray when
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:260:261"/> we are met in publike, and joyne with the Miniſter, but we muſt pray in our Families, pray in our Cloſets, every Family apart, the Husband apart, the Wife apart, the Children apart, the Servants apart, every ſoule apart by himſelfe. And have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care in prayer to put up to God ſuch Petitions as are ſuitable to the buſineſſe of the Sacraments; yea not onely is God to be ſought by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fervent prayer, but when we finde our hearts more dull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward to the worke, it is not amiſſe to quicken and put more life into our prayers by faſting. It may be thou haſt ſuch hardneſſe and deadneſſe in thine heart as can not be caſt out but by faſting and prayer. <hi>Holy faſting</hi> proves an excellent preparative to <hi>holy feaſting.</hi> Faſting <hi>prayers</hi> wil bring feaſting <hi>joyes.</hi> Thus is God in ſpeciall manner to be ſought by prayer. But how this is done is pittifull to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Many know not what praying meanes. He that cannot pray, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:260:261"/> receive the Sacrament as hee ought to doe. How rarely is God ſought apart in the cloſet? Or if any prayer be uſed, what is it but mens cuſtomary formalities that they uſe at all other times, which no more concernes the Sacrament, than the riding of a journey, or going to plough, or any other common occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There is no putting up of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions agreeable to the occaſion, no begging of thoſe particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are to be had in the uſe of the Ordinance. Not one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thinkes on theſe things. Vrge men to prayer in this kinde, and may they not anſwer, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> when in his armour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 39. <hi>I cannot goe with theſe, for I have not beene accuſtomed to them.</hi> So they cannot pray and ſeeke God when they are to come to the Sacrament, becauſe they are not accuſtomed to theſe duties at other times. How can they <hi>pray</hi> before they come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> that <hi>pray</hi> not at other times?
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:260:262"/> And thus we now ſee how we are to prepare our ſelves before we come to the Sacrament. Now therefore be we exhorted to take paines, and to be induſtrious in the doing of theſe duties of preparation; up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Lord will be with you. And for our better encouragement to be painfull and induſtrious in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in theſe duties of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, know this, <hi>That God will never be wanting to true and induſtrious deſires and endeavours.</hi> God will give good and happy ſucceſſe, ſweet and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwers, to all ſuch as ſeek him induſtriouſly in thoſe wayes and meanes that he appoints. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 1, 5. <hi>Zacheus</hi> had a great deſire to ſee Chriſt, but yet had great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The crowd was <hi>great,</hi> and he a <hi>little man.</hi> But his diſcouragements dampe not his deſires, but his deſires make him induſtrious againſt his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. He <hi>runs before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> climbes</hi> up into the Sycamore, or wilde Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, gets him a place there, from
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:260:262"/> whence he might ſee Chriſt over the heads of the multitude. And what comes of all this? Was it labour loſt? Was it paines taken to no purpoſe? No. It proved paines wondrous well worth the while: for do but ſee what followed upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, as ſoone as Chriſt comes neere him, he <hi>lookes</hi> up to, and <hi>ſees</hi> him. It had beene ſmall comfort to have ſeene Chriſt, if Chriſt had not ſeene him. They that ſet themſelves to ſeeke Chriſt, ſhall not onely <hi>ſee</hi> Chriſt, but ſhall be <hi>ſeene</hi> of Chriſt. How many of the multitude ſee Chriſt, crowd, and touch Chriſt, and yet are not once minded, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by Chriſt? But <hi>Zacheus</hi> who is thus painfully induſtrious to ſee Chriſt, both <hi>ſees,</hi> and is <hi>ſeene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee not onely ſees Chriſt, and is ſeene of him, but hee <hi>heares</hi> Chriſt, and heares him call him by his <hi>name,</hi> and in particular to ſpeak to him. For Chriſt to ſpeake to him, and to ſpeake to him by
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:260:263"/> name, being a man he had never ſeene before, how muſt this needs affect and raviſh his heart?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, hee <hi>invites</hi> himſelfe home to his houſe, to be his gueſt, to eat and drinke with him. If he had but barely ſeene Chriſt, it had beene ſome content, he had not altogether loſt his end. But that's not all, Chriſt lookes up to him, caſts up a gracious looke towards him. Oh what a ſweet comfort is it, to have Chriſt looke graciouſly towards one! And yet that's not all neither, but Chriſt ſpeakes to him by name, <hi>Zacheus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> As if hee had ſaid, Though thou knoweſt not me, nor I ever ſaw thee before, yet that thou mayeſt know that I take ſpeciall notice of thee, and beare a ſpeciall favour to thee, <hi>Loe, I call thee by thy Name.</hi> The good Shepherd <hi>knowes his Sheepe, and cals them by name, Iohn</hi> 10. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I call thee by name, and call thee by name as one of my Sheepe. This was ſweet. If Chriſt had ſaid
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:260:263"/> no more but this, Well done <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> thou out of a deſire to ſee me haſt taken paines, now ſee me, look upon me thy fill, that had beene ſweet; but here is more yet, <hi>Zacheus, come downe,</hi> I will go to thine houſe, to thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with thee, thou ſhalt be my Hoſt, and I will be thy gueſt. Since thou haſt taken ſo much paines to run, and climbe, and haſt by thy paines over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all diſcouragements, Come, come downe <hi>Zacheus,</hi> thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine me, have me for thy gueſt, and have ſweet fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with me. So ſweetly, ſo aboundantly, were <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s painfull endeavours recompenſed. Oh, what ſweet and precious figs doth <hi>Zacheus</hi> gather in this wilde fig-tree? Who would not <hi>run</hi> and <hi>climbe,</hi> and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with all his might into ſuch a Tree, to pick ſuch excellent fruit? When we therefore are to come to the Sacrament, do we the like. When we come to the Sacrament, would we not be glad to ſee Chriſt, to have
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:260:264"/> him look graciouſly upon us, to have communion with him, to have him invite himſelfe to us, to have him be a gueſt in our hearts? Would we not be glad to have it thus with us? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is little comfort in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when it is not thus with us. Word and Sacrament both, are but dead and dull ſervices when Chriſt is not ſeene in them; when we heare not his voice, ſee not his face in them. Therefore when we are to come to the Sacrament, looke to that, and provide for it before-hand; that when we are come, we may ſee Chriſt, have him ſee and owne us. But how may that be done? Set thine heart, firſt, ſtrongly to deſire to ſee Chriſt; and then though thou may have diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, that there is a <hi>multitude,</hi> and a <hi>crowd</hi> of duties to be done, and that thy <hi>ſtature</hi> and ſtrength is very little, and therefore no great hope that thou ſhouldeſt get the ſight of Chriſt in the Ordinance; yet for all that, hold on thy deſires to ſee
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:260:264"/> Chriſt, and <hi>run</hi> before, and get up, and though it cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much adoe, yet <hi>climbe up into the Sycamore Tree,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee Chriſt, and have communion with him from the top of that Tree. I, but what is that <hi>Sycamore Tree?</hi> what is this <hi>running before?</hi> what is this <hi>climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up?</hi> It is out of a deſire to ſee and enjoy Chriſt in his Ordinance, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious paines-taking in private du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of preparation, examination, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, and renewing of faith and repentance, and ſtriving in prayer with God. This is <hi>running before,</hi> this is <hi>climbing up into the Sycamore Tree.</hi> And whoſoever takes paines before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, in the fore-named and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled duties of preparation, he runs before, he climbes up into the <hi>Sycamore,</hi> &amp; ſhall ſpeed as happily as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did; ſhal from the top of that <hi>Sycamore,</hi> ſo painfully climbed, ſee Chriſt, and enjoy fellowſhip with him.</p>
               <p>All that come to the Sacrament
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:260:265"/> ſay they deſire to ſee Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him there; and yet to how many doth Chriſt ſay in effect, at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Ezek.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with trembling.</hi> So, Son of man, eat thy Sacramentall bread with qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and drinke the Sacramentall wine with trembling, Go, get your wayes home with a drooping, and an heavie heart. But why ſhould they ſo do? becauſe they ſee not Chriſt, nor Chriſt looks not at them, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes no fellowſhip with them in his Ordinance. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayes he, Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>for God now accepts thy workes:</hi> but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may it be ſaid to many, <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread</hi> at the Sacrament, with ſorrow, and <hi>drink thy wine</hi> at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, with an heavie heart, <hi>for God accepts not thy work,</hi> nor thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice herein. Chriſt doth not looke upon thee, doth not invite himſelfe
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:260:265"/> to thee. And what may the reaſon of it be? Men ſay, they deſire to ſee and injoy Chriſt in the Sacrament, but they doe not <hi>run before,</hi> they doe not take paines to <hi>climbe up into the Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Tree.</hi> Their deſires are, idle, lazie, ſlothfull; there is no induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preparation, no induſtrious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, no induſtrious renewing faith and repentance, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious praying, and painfull ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand. And hence is our miſchiefe and miſcarriage, <hi>we run not, we climbe not,</hi> and therefore <hi>we ſee not.</hi> So long as <hi>Zacheus</hi> kept on the ground, he ſaw not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor could ſee him; but when he had <hi>run before,</hi> and <hi>climbed,</hi> then he doth more than ſee him. Our deſires keepe on the ground, we ſpend no time, wee take no paines, the week, and the day before, and therefore we miſſe the comfortable ſight of Chriſt in the Sacrament. But let our deſires be once <hi>running</hi> and <hi>climbing</hi> deſires, let them once get up in the <hi>Sycamore</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:260:266"/> 
                  <hi>Tree,</hi> and they ſhall finde fruit worth the <hi>running</hi> and the <hi>climbing</hi> for, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 18. <hi>Whoſo keepes the Fig tree, ſhall eat the fruit thereof;</hi> ſo, he that <hi>climbs the Fig-tree, ſhall eat the fruit thereof.</hi> We muſt not thinke that theſe Figs will drop into our mouthes, they muſt climbe for them that will have them, and climbing is painfull. They that will take <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s paines, ſhall reape <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s gaines. A little faith, a faith of as <hi>ſmall a ſtature</hi> as <hi>Zacheus,</hi> if it be induſtrious, and will take paines before-hand, will helpe a man to great benefit and comfort from Chriſt in his Ordinance. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious preparation, examination, prayer, &amp;c. be teadious and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſloathfull fleſh, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a <hi>preſſe</hi> and a <hi>crowd</hi> of earthly buſineſſes that muſt be lookt to, and a <hi>crowd</hi> of duties to be done, that will keepe a man off from a poſſibility of ſeeing Chriſt; yet all the weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe notwithſtanding, and <hi>preſſe</hi> of ſecular buſineſſe notwithſtanding,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:260:266"/> hold thy ſelfe cloſely to this worke, there will come that comfort, and that ſweet in the Sacrament, that will pay for all. Though it were trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to <hi>run before,</hi> though it were a matter of trouble and difficulty to <hi>climbe</hi> and <hi>clamber</hi> into the <hi>Sycamore Tree,</hi> yet findes <hi>Zacheus</hi> that precious fruit therein, that richly payd him for all his paines. Now beſides all this paines in our own perſonall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, we muſt alſo know that we muſt have a care to prepare others, as wee ſtand charged with them in their ſeverall relations to us. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt not onely prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but muſt do their beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their people. As <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ſpeakes to them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves, and prepare your brethren:</hi> ſo it may be ſaid to Miniſters, ſanctifie your ſelves, and prepare your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo to Parents, ſanctifie your ſelves, and prepare your children: ſo to Maſters and Governours, ſanctifie your ſelves; and prepare your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:260:267"/> and your Families. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26, 27. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that when your children ſhall ſay, What mean you by this ſervice, that ye ſhall ſay, It is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover, &amp;c.</hi> And Verſ. 48. <hi>When a ſtranger ſhall ſojourne with thee, and will keepe the Paſſeover to the Lord, let all his males bee circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> Such whom it concerned, muſt looke that he were prepared before he came. Thou ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that haſt others under thy charg, have a care to prepare them, inſtruct them, direct them, call upon them to have a care to come in due Order. If thou know'ſt any ſin or evill in them, admoniſh them, and adviſe them to repentance for it, and to a reſolution to a reformation of it before they come to the Sacrament. And thus much for preparation to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But when I have done all that I can, I muſt ſay, I am an unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant. <hi>When ye have done all thoſe things which are commanded you,</hi> ſayes
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:260:267"/> our Saviour, ſay, <hi>We are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> The Lord then be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto me; for if when I have done all that is commanded me, and when I have done that which is my duty to doe, I muſt ſay, I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant; then how much more muſt I ſay it, that am far ſhort of doing all that in this particular I am commanded to do, and have not done that which is my duty to do? I doubt therefore that I may not come to the Sacrament, becauſe I cannot finde my ſelfe thus prepared; I were better keepe away than come, unleſſe I were thus prepared. I have done what I poſſibly can do, but alas, how ſhort am I of what is required?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, have recourſe here to that which before was ſaid in the laſt point of the ſecond Chapter. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and endeavour to be as exactly prepared as poſſibly thou canſt, but if thou canſt not attaine to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of preparation thou
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:260:268"/> deſireſt, yet if thy heart witneſſe to thee, that what is wanting in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is not from ſloth, idleneſſe, and lothneſſe to take paines, but it is the higheſt degree that with all thy paines thou art able to attaine unto; I ſay unto thee in this caſe, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſpake to <hi>David</hi> in that, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. <hi>Goe, and the Lord be with thee.</hi> Go to the Sacrament, and feare not, but that the Lord will be with thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, if indeed thou haſt no faith, no repentance at all wrought or renewed in thee, I would in any caſe adviſe thee to forbeare; <hi>for why ſhouldeſt thou destroy thy ſelfe,</hi> as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 16. But now deale uprightly, as in Gods preſence, and take heed as well of bearing falſe witneſſe againſt thy ſelf, as againſt thy neighbour. It is a ſin to beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy ſelfe, as well as to foredoe thy ſelfe, and therefore make conſcience of it, deale ſincerely therefore. Dareſt thou confidently, and upon unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:260:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> grounds affirme it, that thou haſt no faith, no repentance? I much feare me, ſayeſt thou, that I have not. That is not the point what thou feareſt, but what thou aſſuredly knoweſt. A man may have much faith that feares hee hath none: yea, there may bee greateſt faith, where there be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt feares. Thou, upon ſerious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of thine owne condition, not upon an ignorant ſelfe-love, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not for a world, reſolutely and peremptorily ſay, thou haſt no faith, no grace, no part in Chriſt; then take heed how thou upon thy feares for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare Gods Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, if thou have done thine utmoſt in the ſincerity of thy ſpirit to fit thy ſelfe for the duty, and thine heart charges thee, neither with any groſſe guilt in thy life, nor with any ſlothfull formality in thy preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though thou canſt not finde thy ſelfe ſo fitted as thou wouldeſt, yet go to the Ordinance, if it be upon conſcience of giving God obedience.
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:260:269"/> Chriſt commands the uſe of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Now though thine owne feares diſcourage and diſ-hearten thee, and when thou lookeſt at thy ſelfe, thou feareſt to go; yet if when thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at Gods commandement, and in the conſcience of it feareſt to ſtay away, here in this conflict of feares, let this laſt feare get the victory; and be more afraid to ſtay from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in regard of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, then to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in regard of thy diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Gods commandement ſayes <hi>Go,</hi> thine own diſcouragements ſayes <hi>Goe not.</hi> Give obedience rather to Gods commandement, than to thine owne feares. Obedience yeelded to God, out of pure conſcience to his commandement; yeelded, I ſay, againſt diſcouragements and feares, may be no whit inferiour unto, nor leſſe acceptable then a preparation in a more exact and excellent degree then yet thou haſt. Such obedience
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:260:269"/> is moſt excellent and moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for that is the moſt excellent obedience, when there is nothing elſe to toll and draw us on but only <hi>Gods</hi> commandement. When a man finds himſelfe in ſuch a frame of ſpirit, as that he queſtions not but to meet with comfort, and a good anſwer at the Sacrament; then poſſibly not Gods commandement, but that comfort may rather ſeeme to draw him to the duty. But now when a man hath ſome diſcouragements, in regard of the feares of the indiſpoſition of his ſpirit, and yet in regard of <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, dares not abſent himſelf, dares not but go: it is cleere, that ſuch obedience is <hi>pure obedience,</hi> becauſe there is nothing to draw him on but Gods commandement, and that hee doth the duty upon this ground, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will have him do it, &amp; that he doth it more for <hi>Gods</hi> ſake, than his own. Excellent is that <hi>Exo.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Moſes, ſpeak unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael that they go forward.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:260:270"/> Why, there was great danger before them, they go upon a manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Sea is before them. As good go <hi>backward</hi> to the Aegyptians, or as good <hi>stand ſtill</hi> and let the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come and put them to the ſword, as to <hi>goe forward.</hi> It is but death to ſtand ſtill, but death to go backward, and it is no better than death to goe forward. What ſafety can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by going into the Sea? Well, for all this, <hi>ſpeake to the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael that they go forward.</hi> Now to go forward, becauſe God commands it, when nothing but preſent danger in ſight, was an argument of pure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: it was not ſafety, but conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of obedience to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that carried them <hi>forwards.</hi> A man in the truth and ſincerity of his ſpirit hath done his utmoſt in his preparation, and yet his heart miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives him that he ſhall ſin to go to the Sacrament, and that he ſhall run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon a manifeſt danger; ſpeake unto ſuch a man <hi>that he go forward,</hi>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:260:270"/> becauſe God commands him to doe him this ſervice, and his going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in obedience, being pure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it ſhall returne him at laſt as great comfort, as if he had beene ſo prepared as his deſire was to have beene.</p>
               <p>

But yet before an anſwer could be returned her, ſhe turned her ſelfe from him, for when Chriſt ſpeakes to her, Verſ. 16. <hi>She turnes her ſelfe to him.</hi> Therefore ſhe had turned away from him, as thinking it a bootleſſe buſineſſe to ſtand talking with him, and inquiring of him about finding of Chriſt.

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:260:271"/> calls her by her name, <hi>Mary.</hi> So that a man may often finde Chriſt, when he leaſt hopes for it.

It is not enough for a man to dreſſe, and trime up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his handſomer apparell before
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:260:272"/> he comes to a great mans table, but there is a great care alſo to be had of that carriage, and behaviour that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes ſuch a mans table, and perſon. Though a man come handſome, and cleanely apparel'd to a great mans Table, yet hee may there carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo rudely, unmannerly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly that hee may give great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. As therefore wee muſt have a care to get our hearts into an holy, and fitting frame before we come, ſo no leſſe muſt our care bee to have them in a convenient frame during the time of the whole action. Though a man have beſtowed much paines with his heart before his comming, yet, if there bee not a care of due behaviour in the action, all his former paines may bee loſt. Though the Prieſts had been carefull to have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed themſelves, and to put on their Prieſtly garments, yet might they be guilty of irregularities at the Altar in not placing the wood, or the parts of the ſacrifice in due order, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 1.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:260:272"/> Therefore as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in the generall, ſo it may be ſaid in this particular, 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Looke to your ſelves that wee looſe not thoſe things which wee have wrought,</hi> &amp;c. So looke to your ſelves when yee have beſtowed a great deale of time, and paines in preparation, that by a looſe, and careleſſe carriage in the duely do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you looſe not the things you have done.

The ſweeter our meditation is, the more is the heart prepared, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prayſes, thankeſgiving, and joy in the Lord. Therefore a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall duty to bee done at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, to take up our hearts with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meditation. And for the better raiſing and feeding meditation, it is good when we are come to the Lords Table, to doe as <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſhes us to doe in that caſe, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23. 1. <hi>When thou ſitteſt to eate with a Ruler, conſider diligently what is before thee.</hi> He adviſes it for a mans better cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if hee be a man given to his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,

Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is ſet before thee, what is done before thee. Conſider the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall elements, the ſacramentall promiſes, and ſacramentall actions.

                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 26. 6.</note> How prodigious a darkeneſſe was there at Chriſt's paſſion for three houres together? Surely a ſpeciall end of this darkneſſe, was to ſhew the dreadfull and horrible wrath of God againſt his owne Sonne, now hanging on the croſſe, a ſacrifice for the worlds ſinnes, was it nothing, or was it but a ſmall matter that God did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his wrath againſt him, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe the tongues, and hands of all his carnall enemies againſt him, but that the Lord himſelfe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would reveale his wrath againſt the unrighteouſneſſe of the world, which now lay upon him. Now ſtood Chriſt in our ſtead, we ſhould have ſuffered the horrour of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ever, even that <hi>blackneſſe of darkneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> calls it. Now Chriſt
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:260:275"/> undertaking for us he ſuffers <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> And God by this, as by a viſible ſigne, would teſtifie, that the <hi>blackneſſe of darkeneſſe,</hi> cauſed by Gods wrath for ſin, was upon him. Thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wee in ſome ſort the ſad plight, and wofull agony in which Chriſt then was. God cauſes <hi>the Sun to ſhine upon the Iuſt, and the unjuſt, Mat.</hi> 5. 45. But now, that Chriſt is a ſacrifice for our ſinnes, and to ſuffer his Fathers wrath for them, he muſt not have ſo much as the common comfort of the light of the Sunne, but as if hee were of all vnjuſt ones the moſt unjuſt; the very light of the Sunne ſhall be taken from him, and hee be left in horrid darkneſſe. Do but looke upon Chriſt on the croſſe, under all our ſins lying upon him, and how heavie a preſſe, how ponderous a waight was that? But conſider beſides this, how many were the paines of his body by their inhumane, and barbarous uſages? what was the bitter exacerbation of his Spirit, by ſo many baſe and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:260:276"/> reproches of all his malignant oppoſites, what, was it nothing to be ſcourged? to give his cheekes to the ſmiters? to be ſpitefully intreated, to be ſpitted on, and indure all thoſe outragious inſolencies of his enemies before, and at his crucifying? Oh! how bitter were theſe things? But conſider beſides all this, to have all the power of Hell againſt him, and all thoſe Lyons, Bulls, Vnicornes, and Dogs, to be taken up, and imployed in aſſaulting and afflicting him. Oh! how paſt all conception of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man was the ſmart of this miſery? Heere was <hi>Earth</hi> againſt him; here was <hi>Hell</hi> againſt him. And yet <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> not enough, but <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelfe againſt him. After all this, to have God his Father from <hi>Heaven</hi> by this prodigious, dreadfull, and long darkeneſſe, to teſtifie his wrath againſt him: here was that which added waight and perfection to all the reſt. To be three whole houres together under a viſible ſigne

Thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we to our ſelves Chriſt hanging on the croſſe; thus, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God</hi> roſting in the fire of wrath; yea, further, After that we have ſeene Chriſt thus for three houres ſpace in deepe ſilence, conflicting in this time of darkneſſe with all theſe ſorrowes, Now as not able any longer to hold his peace, thinke wee that we heare him by that formidable cry, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the bitterneſſe, and unutterable extremity of his paſſion: <hi>My God, my God, Why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> All theſe three darke houres was Chriſt drinking this bitter cup, and now at the third houres end was he come to the dregs and lees of it. This was the ſharpeſt paroxiſme and fit of his paſſion. Now were the enveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med arrowes of the Almighty ſhot

And how can we ſee, and heare Chriſt ſuffering all this for us, and not withall in our meditations ſtand aſtoniſhed at the heynouſneſſe and hideouſneſſe of our ſinnes, for which no other way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation could be made, but by this bitter paſſion of Chriſt. Behold in the paſſion of Chriſt as in a glaſſe, the greatneſſe of ſinne. Thinke we ſadly with our ſelves, Surely ſinne againſt God muſt needs be more than men commonly eſteeme it.

But for the death of Chriſt, his love in it, and the benefits by it, we have not onely ſome <hi>Pſalmes of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16. 22, and 69. and others, but beſides, the Lord Chriſt hath to the worlds end appointed a <hi>Sacrament of Remembrance,</hi> that this great worke of CHRISTS death, and his infinite love, and mercy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in might above all other workes bee meditated upon, and had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. One ſpecially in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts is worth our notice. Some of Chriſts workes are ſpecified only by
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:260:279"/> one Evangeliſt, at his turning of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wine, as his healing the ſick man at the poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> his healing that blind man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. Some of them are ſpecified by two Evangeliſts, as the hiſtory of Chriſts birth by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> Some things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by three of them as the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But as for Chriſts death, and Paſſion it is recorded by them all foure. Onely two write the Hiſtory of his birth, but all foure the Hiſtory of his death, without doubt to teach us, that though all Chriſts workes, and actions are to be ſeriouſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, meditated upon, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, yet none ſo ſpeciall as his death, and ſufferings.

Therefore ought men to make ſpeciall conſcience of this duely. How cold, and dead a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſts death is the

The bleſſed Sonne of GOD to ſtrip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his glory, to humble and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelfe to the ignominious, and accurſed death of the Croſſe?

And ſhall I now ſee my ſins lye ſo heavy upon him, as to make him ſweate bloud; ſhall I ſee him even ſqueezed under the huge weight of my ſinnes; ſhall I ſee my ſinnes crowne him with thornes, nayle his hands, and feete to the Croſſe, Gore his ſide with the ſpeare, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierced heart?

The word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a latine word that ſignifies an <hi>Oath,</hi> to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>receive an Oath,</hi> And when we receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> we ſhould binde our ſelves in a ſolemne Covenant with <hi>God</hi> to forſake all our ſins, and to walk in new and better obedience before GOD. And that practice of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance riſes thus. In the <hi>Sacrament</hi> I ſee CHRIST crucified for my ſins. And was CHRIST crucified for my ſins? Surely then I reſolve, and vow too, and covenant with <hi>God</hi> that I will uſe my ſins as I ſee they have uſed CHRIST. They pierced him, I will pierce them, they killed, and put him to death, LORD I will doe by them, as they have done by thee, I will kill, crucifie, and put them
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:260:285"/> to death. LORD CHRIST thou gaveſt thy ſelfe for me. Behold here I am, and here I give my ſelfe to thee. That ſame is to be done in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which we finde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18. <hi>This day the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to doe theſe Statutes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord hath avouched thee this day,</hi> &amp;c. So may it bee ſaid of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> day; <hi>This day</hi> the LORD thy GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to keepe his Statutes, &amp;c. And <hi>this day</hi> thou <hi>haſt avouched</hi> the LORD to be thy GOD, and to walke is his wayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>this day</hi> the LORD <hi>hath avouched thee</hi> to be one of his. There ſhould be in a <hi>Sacrament</hi> a <hi>mutuall avouchment</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD, and his people. When wee come to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as wee come that GOD may <hi>avouch</hi> us for his people, ſo we ſhould come to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch</hi> him for our GOD, and that we will keepe his Commandements. We can have no comfort in the uſe of
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:260:286"/> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> unleſſe in it <hi>God avouch</hi> us for his people. And wee have no reaſon to thinke that <hi>God</hi> will <hi>avouch</hi> us for his people, unleſſe wee will <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch</hi> him to be our GOD, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him the renoucing of our luſts, and yeelding him obedience. This therefore is to be done in the Sacrament, <hi>Lord avouch me for thine, as I avouch, and covenant my ſelfe to be thine</hi> in all obedience to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>It muſt be with us at a Sacrament, as it was with the <hi>Iewes</hi> of ancient in a Sacrifice. In Sacrifices the people did not onely offer their oblation, and performe that ſervice, but withall they did in Sacrificing renew, and make their covenants afreſh, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of offering up themſelves a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and acceptable Sacrifice, of mortification of their brutiſh luſts, of an holy, and obedient life. So much implyes, as that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. So that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. <hi>Gather my Saints to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, thoſe that have made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

                  <hi>with me by Sacrifice.</hi> Therefore in Sacrifices there was a making of covenant with GOD. The ſame muſt be done in the Sacrament of the Supper, wee muſt there renew our Baptiſmall covenant. For in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament there is, and muſt be a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtipulation, and ſponſion betweene GOD, and the ſoule of a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, that as we expect GOD ſhould binde himſelfe to us, ſo hee expects that wee ſhould binde our ſelves to him. As <hi>David</hi> joynes the <hi>cup of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and the <hi>paying of his vowes</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 13, 14. <hi>I will take the cup of my ſalvation, I will pay my vowes unto the Lord,</hi> ſo ſhould wee joyne the <hi>cup of bleſsing</hi> and the <hi>making of our vowes</hi> together, I will take the <hi>cup of bleſsing,</hi> I will make <hi>my vowes</hi> unto the <hi>Lord</hi> now in the preſence of all his people. And thus in theſe two things muſt there be a practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

The great, and chiefe work of the Sacrament comes now to be done in the <hi>Actuating of faith</hi> ſo, as to fetch forth the fat, and marrow of the Ordinance. For the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:260:287"/> and practiſing of this point we muſt know theſe foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That CHRIST is an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient fulneſſe for the thorow ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all the wants, and neceſſities of our ſoules whatſoever they may be, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell. Firſt</hi> then, there is a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> in him. <hi>Secondly, All fulneſſe</hi> is in him. Looke whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that is required to bee in a Mediator, it is <hi>all fully</hi> in him, it hath it <hi>all</hi> to the <hi>full. Thirdly,</hi> He ſaies not ſimply that this fulneſſe is in him, but that this <hi>fulneſſe dwells</hi> in him. A Veſſell may bee full, and a Treaſury may be full, but theſe may be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied againe, and ſo an emptineſſe may follow that fulneſſe. But this fulneſſe <hi>dwells</hi> in him, it is an Inhabitant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, permanent fulneſſe, ſo as he is, and ever ſhall bee full. There is in him a <hi>fulneſſe of merit</hi> for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and a <hi>fulneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall graces, and ſo a fulneſſe of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacies, vertues, as mortifying, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:260:288"/> quickning vertues. And thus he is full of all <hi>kindes</hi> of Graces, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>He hath the ſeven ſpirits of God.</hi> And <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 2, 3. with which that ſuites, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14. And therefore not onely <hi>Treaſures,</hi> but <hi>All the treaſures of wiſedome, and knowledge are hid in him, Col.</hi> 2. 3. And all theſe Graces he hath in the higheſt, and fulleſt degree. Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaies not, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. In whom is <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>wiſedome,</hi> but the <hi>treaſures</hi> of knowledge, <hi>treaſures</hi> of wiſedome. Some peeces of ſilver and gold are not <hi>treaſures,</hi> but the treaſures are vaſt heapes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus filled, and enriched for the behoofe of his Church, and members, that he may conveigh and communicate unto them of his fulneſſe for the ſupply of their wants. There is in CHRIST not only a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>abundance,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which he is ſufficiently full in himſelfe, but alſo a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> by which he overflowes, and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:260:288"/> fills all his Saints. His fulneſſe is not onely a <hi>full fulneſſe,</hi> but a <hi>filling ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Iohn</hi> 1. 14, 16. <hi>Full of Grace, and Truth, and of his fulneſſe have we all received and grace for grace, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Which is the fulneſſe of him that fills all in all.</hi> There is ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance powred out upon him, as that he is not onely full, but he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>good meaſure running over,</hi> ſo as to fill all the empty ſoules, and all the empty hearts of his people. For look what CHRIST received, he received for us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved gifts for men;</hi> That is, gifts to give unto men, as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>When he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon high, he gave gifts unto men.</hi> So that he received to give, he was filled to fill. He is the well head, the fountaine which is not onely full it ſelfe, but ſprings, and flowes over to the filling of ſtreames. He received a fulneſſe, that we might receive of his fulneſſe, and that hee might derive of his fulnes to us.</p>

                  </gap>iſtery of the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He preaches to him, and he baptiſes him, and ſo by theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances is the HOLY GHOST con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:260:291"/> unto him. We finde mention made, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>of two Olive bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which thorow two golden pipes emptied the golden oyle out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Thoſe two Olive branches emptied golden oyle out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the golden Candelſticke, but yet they did it thorow the two <hi>golden pipes.</hi> So it is in this caſe; All golden oyle it is in CHRIST, Hee is the <hi>Branch,</hi> as <hi>Zechary</hi> calls him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 3. He is the <hi>olive Branch,</hi> and the <hi>olive tree</hi> from whom comes all the golden oyle of grace, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall comfort, and he it is that emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it out of himſelfe into our hearts. But yet he doth empty it into our hearts by his Ordinances, they be the <hi>golden pipes</hi> by which this <hi>golden oyle</hi> is conveighed. CHRIST doth not ordinarily empty the oyle into our hearts immediately, but firſt into the golden pipes of his Ordinances, his Word, and Sacrament, and ſo thorow them into our hearts. The graces and comforts of the HOLY
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:260:292"/> GHOST are oft in Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>oyle,</hi> and the powring forth of thoſe graces to <hi>Anoynting.</hi> To this purpoſe is that ſpeech of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 92. 10. <hi>I ſhall bee anoynted with freſh oyle,</hi> or greene oyle, that is, thou ſhalt adde freſh meaſures, and new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes of the graces of thy ſpirit. So that after the firſt gift of the ſpirit, in the firſt worke of grace, GOD often annoynts his people with freſh oyle, and that hee doth in the Word and Sacrament. He annoynts them in the miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1, 3. <hi>The Lord hath annoynted me to preach good tydings, to give the oyle of joy for mourning. God</hi> anoynts his Miniſters, that they may annoynt his people. By preaching the <hi>Goſpell God anoynts</hi> his people with the oyle of gladneſſe. So he anoynts us in the uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper, there in ſpeciall manner he annoynts with freſh oyle. God deales at this ſpirituall feaſt as the Iewes uſed to doe in their feaſts, they uſed in token of welcome to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:260:292"/> anoynt their gueſts, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 46. Our Saviour tells Simon the Phariſee, <hi>Minc head with oyle thou didſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt,</hi> that is, thou haſt not bid mee welcome, nor cheered me. God at the Sacrament annoynts the heads of his people. That looke as <hi>Mary</hi> did with CHRIST, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 2, 3. <hi>There they made him a Supper—Then tooke Mary a pound of oyntment of ſpikenard, and annoynted the feete of</hi> IESUS; Then. When? Namely when at the Supper they made him. So deales the LORD with his people at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>There</hi> hee makes them a Supper, it is the <hi>Lords Supper, then</hi> takes the LORD precious oyntment, and annoynts their heads with freſh oyle, <hi>there</hi> they have freſh unctions, and freſh delibutions, <hi>there</hi> he gives them freſh, and new comforts, freſh ſupplies, and new meaſures of grace, <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> hee annoyntes them at the Sacrament, yea the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the very <hi>Alabaſter box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntment,</hi> and out of this box
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:260:293"/> God powers it on their heades as ſhe on Chriſts head <hi>as hee ſate at meate, Matth.</hi> 27. 7. So that a man may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake of the Lords Table, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> of his owne, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Thou preparedſt a Table before mee, thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynteſt mine head with oyle.</hi> When God prepares this Table for his, and they prepare themſelves aright and in due order for this Table, and come as they ought to doe, God doth at this Table feaſt them, and annoynt their heads with oyle, cheeres them, and bids them heartily welcome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the way to make this ordinance thus effectuall to us is the Actuating, and ſetting our faith on worke upon the ordinance, and Chriſt in the ordinance. Chriſt is full, Chriſt communicates of his fulneſſe, Chriſt communicates of his fulneſſe by his ordinance, but yet if now at the ordinance our faith lye ſtill, and ſtirre not, if our faith be idle, or a ſleepe, here is nothing done, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gotten at the ordinance, but the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:260:293"/> Sacrament proves a dry empty huske unto us, there is neither oyle, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing to be had. Therefore now the maine worke of all at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to awaken, and Actuate our faith, and to ſet it on worke upon Chriſt in his ordinance, and ſo draw forth the efficacy of Chriſt, and his ordinance. The power of God is preſent in his ordinance to heale, and to helpe, but now withall the power of our faith muſt alſo be preſent to ſet this power of God on worke, to make the ordinance an healing, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ordinance. If Gods power be preſent, and our faith be abſent, or as good as abſent, Gods power will not work, for then will his power work, when our faith workes. A conduit is full of water, now a man that would fill his veſſel, muſt bring it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, muſt bring it to the cocke, and ſet it there, but yet that is not enough, if that be all, and he doe no more, he may goe home againe with an empty veſſell: Therfore the man that would
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:260:294"/> fill his veſſell when he hath brought it to the conduit, and ſet it under the cocke, he alſo turnes the cocke, and then the water runnes forth, and fills the veſſell. So here, Chriſt is the conduit of all grace, and ſpirituall good, hee that would bee filled muſt come to him. His ordinances the word, and Sacrament they are the cockes of this conduit, ſo that a man that would be filled, muſt not only goe to Chriſt, but to Chriſt in theſe ordinances muſt bring his veſſell to theſe cockes. And thats not enough, but when he is come to them, he muſt turne them; faith Actuated, and working upon the ordinance that turnes the cocke, and then the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and vertues of <hi>Chriſt</hi> flow forth, then theſe waters powre forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. See that ſpeech, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Therefore with joy ſhall yee draw waters out of the wells of ſalvation. Chriſt</hi> he is indeed a well full of water: But now as the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid to our <hi>Saviour, Iohn</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Sir, thou haſt</hi>
                  <pb n="555" facs="tcp:260:294"/> 
                  <hi>nothing to draw with, and the well is deepe, from whence then haſt thou that living water?</hi> So in this caſe, Chriſt is indeed the well of ſalvation, but yet this <hi>Well is deepe,</hi> and how can a man fetch up thoſe waters thence, if hee have nothing to <hi>draw</hi> with? <hi>God</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his goodneſſe hath provided us <hi>buckets</hi> to fetch up theſe waters out of this well, and they are his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. But now though there be a well ſtored with abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and though alſo there be buckets to fetch up theſe waters, yet if a man doe not let downe, and draw up theſe buckets he cannot draw waters out of the Well. Now the ſetting faith on worke in uſe at the ordinances, and the Actuating of it therein, that is the letting downe, and drawing up theſe buckets, that is the turning of the wheele which drawes up the buckets with water. Chriſt is the <hi>Well</hi> of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the ordinances are the <hi>buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi> faith Actuated, and ſet on worke in the uſe of the ordinances, is the
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:260:295"/> 
                  <hi>drawing</hi> of waters up out of the well of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>See how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 41. <hi>Hee opened the Rocke, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters guſhed out, they ranne in the dry places like a River.</hi> Waters guſhed out of the Rocke: but when? when the <hi>Rocke was opened.</hi> So Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Chriſt in thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances have abundance of waters in them, ſuch abundance as guſhes out to the refreſhing of dry ſoules, but yet firſt theſe Rockes muſt bee broken up, theſe Rockes muſt bee opened. But how muſt theſe Rockes come to be opened? As the Rocke in Horeb was opened, <hi>Exodus</hi> 17. 6. <hi>Behold I will ſtand before thee there upon the Rocke in Horeb, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Rocke, and there ſhall come water out of it, that the people may drinke.</hi> GOD <hi>ſtood</hi> upon the Rocke, but <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt <hi>ſmite</hi> the Rocke, and then comes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of it, that the people may drinke. God is preſent in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and his power is preſent at
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:260:295"/> them, <hi>The power of God was preſent to heale them, Luk.</hi> 5. 17. but yet before water will come out that wee may drinke, we muſt firſt ſmite the Rock, and when it is ſmitten then ſhall wee have it opened, and waters guſhing out. Now what is this ſmiting of the Rocke? It is nothing elſe but the Actuating of our faith, and ſetting it on work in the uſe of the Ordinance, faith Actuated &amp; ſet on work <hi>ſmites</hi> the Rocke, <hi>breakes</hi> up,, and <hi>opens</hi> the Rocke. So that in an Ordinance, and at the Sacrament that ſhould bee a mans wiſedome which was <hi>Moſes</hi> his errour, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 11. with his Rod he <hi>ſmote the Rocke twice,</hi> and the water came out abundantly. Smite the Rocke twice, againe, and againe, Actuate wee our faith, and then the water ſhall come out abundantly.</p>
               <p>Gods Ordinances, or CHRIST in them, is not onely a Rocke from whence waters come forth, but they are Rockes from whence <hi>Oyle,</hi> and <hi>Honey</hi> iſſue forth. That a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:260:296"/> may ſay of the Sacrament as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 29. 6. <hi>The Rocke powred mee out rivers of Oyle.</hi> And this Rocke powers out <hi>Honey.</hi> But how and when? Doth it powre forth rivers of Oyle, and Honey to all commers? No ſuch matter. How many neither finde <hi>Oyle,</hi> nor <hi>Honey</hi> thereat? But how come men to have honey, and oyle at this Rock? when men doe as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of Iſrael <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>He made him to</hi> ſucke <hi>Honey out of the Rocke, and oyle out of the flinty Rocke.</hi> God gave Iſrael ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and oyle out of the Rocke, but how? Did he make the Rocke drop it into their mouthes, whileſt they ſtood gazing, and looking upon it? No. <hi>He made him to ſucke it.</hi> If hee had beene ſo idle as not to have taken the paines to have <hi>ſuckt</hi> it, hee might have lickt his lippes long enough af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, ere he had had it, ere he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, much leſſe have beene filled with it. So thus men come to have oyle, and honey out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:260:296"/> and CHRIST in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they <hi>ſucke:</hi> when Faith is Actuated, and ſet on worke in the uſe of the Ordinance, and applyes Chriſt in it, then faith <hi>ſuckes,</hi> and when faith ſuckes, then it fetches <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and <hi>oyle</hi> out of the <hi>Rocke.</hi> As the Prophet ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 11. <hi>That yee may</hi> ſucke <hi>and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the breaſts of her conſolation,</hi> ſo in this. There muſt bee <hi>ſucking</hi> before there can be <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> The word, and Sacraments, are <hi>breaſts of conſolation,</hi> and theſe be full of ſweet milke, but there can be no <hi>ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> unleſſe there be <hi>ſucking.</hi> A child may handle the mothers breaſts, may play with them, may kiſſe them, but all this while the child is never the fuller; Therefore the child when it would be ſatisfied, it layes its mouth to the breaſt, gets the nipple into the mouth, and then ſuckes, and drawes with all the ſtrength, and might and ſo fetches forth the milke out of the mothers breaſt. So muſt it be in theſe
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:260:297"/> caſe. Men may come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gaze upon the elements, and eate, and drinke them, and yet not receive the ſweete of the Ordinance, but if they would have the milke out of this <hi>breaſt,</hi> they muſt fall to <hi>ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and to <hi>drawing</hi> with all their power, and ſtrength. Then doe men ſucke, and draw the breaſt of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when in the uſe of it they Actuate, and ſet their faith on work. Faith Actuated ſuckes vertue out of he Sacrament, ſuckes from Chriſt in the Sacrament mortifying vertue to kill luſts, healing vertue to cure the pollutions of the heart, quickning vertue to enable to duties, and actions of ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p>Look how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in that caſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. 10. <hi>Waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</hi> So is it to all true beleevers in the Sacrament. They have therein full draughts of Chriſts bloud, they have their hearts filled as with the comforts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo with
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:260:297"/> the efficacies of Chriſt, they have <hi>waters of a full cup.</hi> But how come they by theſe waters of a full cup? They are <hi>wrung out</hi> to them. And how are they wrung out to them? Faith being ſet on worke in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and working upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that <hi>wrings</hi> out waters of a full cup, that <hi>wrings</hi> out the juyce, the ſap, and ſweete of the Sacrament, that <hi>wrings</hi> and preſſes out the ſucculency of it. It is juſt here as it was in the dreame of Pharaohs Butler, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 10, 11. <hi>The cluſters of the Vine brought forth ripe grapes, and Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs cup was in mine hand, and I took the grapes, and</hi> preſſed <hi>them into Pharaohs cup.</hi> The Sacrament is as a Vine ſet before us, full of cluſters of rippe grapes, and theſe grapes full of Iuyce, Chriſt with all his fulneſſe offered to us in this Ordinance. Now our care, and courſe ſhould bee to have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, and bloud of theſe grapes powred into the cup of our hearts. How may that bee done now? As
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:260:298"/> Pharaohs cup came filled. <hi>Hee tooke the grapes</hi> and <hi>preſſed</hi> them, and <hi>cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them into Pharaohs cup, and ſo the cup was filled. So muſt wee take theſe grapes, and preſſe, and cruſh them, wee muſt ſqueeze forth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of them. That we doe when faith is Actuated, and is ſet on worke in the uſe of the ordinance. Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith takes theſe grapes, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them, and wrings out of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that which fills our hearts.</p>
               <p>When therefore we are come to the Sacrament, and now are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſet we all the Powers of our faith on worke. Lift up this eye to ſee Chriſt, reach out this hand to lay hold upon, and receive him, ſet this mouth on feeding, eating, drinking, ſucking. Set the mouth of thy faith to the breaſt of the Sacrament, and <note place="margin">Quomodo ergo capiunt, qui lac capiunt?

So ſhould a man doe at, and with the Sacrament, as Chriſts Diſciples did when they paſſed through the corne fields, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>And his Diſciples plucked the eares of the corne, and did eate, rubbing them in their hands.</hi> They did not plucke off the eares, and ſo eate the whole ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, but firſt they <hi>rubbed the eares</hi> in their hands to fetch out the corne. So at the Sacrament ſet faith on worke, to rub the eares, and fetch out the corne that is in them for foode. A rub'd eare will yeeld corne fit for foode, but there is no eating of eares unrub'd without danger, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 33. <hi>Surely the charming of milke brings forth butter.</hi> They muſt charme therefore, and charme hard,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:260:299"/> ſet their faith hard to this worke of charming, that will have butter, that will have benefit out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is oyle in olives, but before there could be oyle fetcht out of them to anoynt a mans ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they uſed to <hi>treade</hi> the olives, and ſo expreſſe the oyle out of them, as appeares, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt treade</hi> the olives, <hi>but ſhalt not anoynt thee with oyle.</hi> It is threatned as a Iudgement, but yet it implyes that oyle was fetcht forth by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſtamping, bruiſing, and breaking of the olives with their feete. The Ordinances of Gods word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are <hi>olives,</hi> full of good, full of excellent oyle, but theſe olives will not drop oyle upon us, they muſt be ſtampt and trod, if we would have oyle out of them to anoint our ſelves. Faith Actuated, and ſet on worke in, and upon theſe ordinances, that treads theſe olives, and helpes us to the oyle of them. And how-ever the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in that place threatens it as a
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:260:299"/> judgement that they ſhould <hi>tread O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> and not <hi>anoynt themſelves,</hi> yet it never ſo falls out in this caſe. He that Actuates his faith, and ſets it ſoundly on work to tread theſe olives, he ſhall be ſure to <hi>dippe his foote in oyle,</hi> and to be comfortably anoynted in the uſe of the Ordinance. It is only the want of faiths taking of paines in induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treading of the olives, that makes us go away dry headed, dry hearted, and unanoynted from the Sacrament and all other Ordinances. Thus muſt faith worke hard at the Sacrament, and eate her bread in the ſweate of her browes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is faith to be Actuated, and ſet on worke in the uſe of the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Sacrament conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three things.

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:260:300"/> 1 Firſt, in the Sacrament we have <hi>Sacramentall offers,</hi> Chriſt Himſelfe is offered with all his benefits. <hi>Take, eate, drinke.</hi> I ſee then God offers me Chriſt to be taken, His body to be eaten, His bloud to be drunke. Here then muſt faith Actuate it ſelfe, and ſet it ſelfe on worke, ſtriving with all it's might to take Chriſt, to eate, and drinke Chriſt offered. Lord Chriſt, as verily as I take, and eate, and drink theſe outward Sacramental elements, ſo verily doe I by my faith receive thy ſelfe into my ſoule, and feede up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee for ſpirituall nouriſhment. Chriſt is offered to us, offers to come in, and enter into our hearts. The Act of faith now then is that, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 24. 7. <hi>Lift up your heads, ô yee gates, and be yee lift up yee everlaſting doores.</hi> But why muſt theſe gates, and doores of their hearts be thus lift up? <hi>And the King of glory ſhal come in,</hi> Chriſt is come, and he makes an offer to come into your hearts, open therefore the gates of your hearts, <hi>lift them up,</hi> even
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:260:300"/> from off the hookes, that faire, and full way may be made for his ready entrance: when a great man, ſpecially a King comes to a mans houſe, he will not only open the ſmall wicket, his little doore, but he ſets open his great gates, throwes them wide open to make ſpatious way for his entrance. Now Chriſt in the Sacrament offers Himſelfe to come to us, the King of glory offers to come in. Here then let thy faith buſily beſtirre it ſelfe in widning the paſſage, and opening thine heart to make Chriſt way, now ſtrive might and maine to ſtretch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thine heart to ſuch a breadth, and largeneſſe as a fit way may be made for the King of glory to enter. Doe in receiving Chriſt at the Sacrament, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did in receiving him into his houſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Make hast, and come downe, for to day I muſt abide at thine houſe.</hi> Here Chriſt offers Himſelfe to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> and upon the offer made, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <hi>Zacheus made haſte, and came</hi>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:260:301"/> 
                  <hi>downe, and received him joyfully.</hi> Think upon that gratious offer of Chriſts how <hi>Zacheus</hi> beſtirred himſelfe, with what haſte he leaped down from the Tree, with what readineſſe, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe he brought CHRIST home, with what ſweetneſſe of affection he claſpes about CHRIST when he entertained him into his houſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes thy ſoule the ſame offer at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> now let thy faith as buſily beſtir herſelfe as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>haſten, open,</hi> claſpe, embrace, welcome, and receive CHRIST thus offered to thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Sacrament wee have <hi>Sacramentall promiſes. This is my body. This is my bloud. This is my body which is given for you, my blood which is ſhed for you. Shed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes. Take, Eate, Drinke,</hi> ſaies our Saviour. Well what if we doe ſo, what ſhall we get by it? What ſhall we be the better for it? A great deale the better, for <hi>this is my body, my bloud;</hi> I promiſe you in the uſe of this
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:260:301"/> Ordinance you ſhall receive my <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and my <hi>bloud,</hi> that <hi>body</hi> which was once crucified and offered for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world: that bloud which was ſhed for Recon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>ll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive efficacious vertue of my quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death. So that theſe are <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall promiſes.</hi> So that here is that which may abundantly ſet faith on worke, for the promiſes are the moſt proper object for faith to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well then, CHRIST ſaies, <hi>This is my body given for you, my bloud ſhed for you, ſhed for the remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Let faith now beleeve theſe promiſes, Lord I beleeve that thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>was given for me,</hi> thy bloud <hi>ſhed for me,</hi> thy bloud ſhed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>of my ſins,</hi> Lord I cheerefully and gladly beleeve that I am now made partaker of thy <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> and that my ſinnes are pardoned in thy <hi>bloud.</hi> Faith muſt doe here, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 6, 7. <hi>God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
                  <pb n="570" facs="tcp:260:302"/> 
                  <hi>in his holineſſe,</hi> that is, hee hath made me a gracious promiſe that he will bring all the land under mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Here <hi>David</hi> hath Gods promiſe, marke now what followes: <hi>I will rejoyce,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will divide Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, I will mete out the valley of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth, Gilead is mine, Manaſſeh is mine.</hi> See how hee actuates his faith upon Gods promiſe ſo as to rejoyce, ſo as to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Sechem, Succoth, Gilead, and Manaſſeh.</hi> So Chriſt hath ſpoken in, or by his holineſſe, <hi>This is my body which is given for you, this is my bloud which is ſhed for you, for the remiſsion of your ſins.</hi> Here be Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall promiſes. Now upon the view of theſe promiſes ſhould a man Actuate his faith, and ſay, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> I will eate <hi>Christs</hi> fleſh, I will drinke his bloud. <hi>Chriſt is mine,</hi> His death <hi>is mine,</hi> His Reſurrection <hi>is mine,</hi> Remiſſion of ſin <hi>is mine,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Heaven <hi>are mine.</hi> And thus by this Actuation of faith ſhould a man with <hi>Iohn, leane on</hi> CHRISTS
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:260:302"/> 
                  <hi>boſome, Iohn</hi> 13. 23. When he is at the Sacrament, ſo participating of him, as to have communion with him in all his benefits Thus <hi>leane wee on our beloved, Cant.</hi> 8. 5. when at the Sacrament. Againe; This is my <hi>bloud ſhed for you, for the remiſsion of ſinne.</hi> Loe here is that bloud offered me to drinke, and promiſed to me in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by the ſhedding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, remiſſion of ſin was purchaſed, yea here is remiſſion of ſin, not onely offered me, and promiſed me, but of fered, and promiſed under ſeale. Now then Actuate thy faith, and ſay, <hi>Lord</hi> I accept, <hi>Lord</hi> I beleeve this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led pardon of my ſin. And faith thus Actuated, will make good unto us the Sacramentall promiſes; for as it is true in caſe of prayer, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>What things ſoever you deſire when yee pray, beleeve that ye receive them, and yee ſhall have them,</hi> ſo is it as true in caſe of receiving. What things ſoever ye deſire when ye receive, doe but Actuate your faith, and ſet that on
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:260:303"/> worke for them, beleeve that yee receive them, and yee ſhall have them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>Sacrament</hi> we have <hi>Sacramentall repreſentations.</hi> There is in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> a viſible remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of CHRISTS death, and in the breaking of the bread, and powring out the wine, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Chriſts death, and Paſſion. When I ſee the wine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, it repreſents unto me the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſts bloud, here I ſee Chriſts bloud ſhed on the Croſſe. What is to be done now when I ſee this bloud in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Do but conſider that ſame, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 6, 8. <hi>Moſes tooke of the bloud of the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and put it in baſons, and he tooke the bloud, that was in the baſons, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it upon the people,</hi> haply with a bunch of hyſope, as the manner was, to which <hi>David</hi> alludes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Purge me with hyſope.</hi> Now ſo muſt it be here: The bloud of our burnt offering which was ſhed for us, the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:260:303"/> Lord hath put in <hi>baſons,</hi> in the <hi>baſons</hi> of the Word, and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and out of theſe <hi>baſons</hi> it muſt be ſprinkled. The <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Supper</hi> is one <hi>baſon</hi> in which this bloud is put. This bloud is held forth in <hi>this baſon,</hi> This is <hi>my bloud.</hi> Now when this bloud is held forth to us in this <hi>baſon,</hi> wee ſhould <hi>ſprinkle</hi> our ſelves with this bloud. That muſt be done by Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our faith, and by the act of faith applying that bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto our ſelves. We finde mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. of <hi>faith in Chriſts bloud,</hi> there is not onely faith in <hi>Chriſts Name,</hi> but <hi>faith in his bloud.</hi> Faith when Chriſts bloud is holden out to us either in the Word, or <hi>Sacrament,</hi> puts her hand into this <hi>baſon,</hi> or dippes the <hi>hyſſope</hi> into the bloud in the <hi>baſon,</hi> and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkles a mans ſoule therewith. Faith applying CHRISTS bloud to a mans ſelfe, doth put her hand into the <hi>baſon,</hi> doth dip the hyſſop into the bloud in the <hi>baſon,</hi> ye doth with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas put her hands</hi> into the wounds of
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:260:304"/> CHRIST, and take bloud thence, and beſprinkles the ſoule withall. When therfore we ſee CHRISTS bloud in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we are to take it, and beſprinkle our ſelves with it, that is, we are to have faith in his bloud, and by faith to apply the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſts death unto our owne ſoules. And this application is the Actuation of faith.</p>
               <p>Nay that is not all, faith ſeeing the wounds, and the bloud of Chriſt, not <note place="margin">Cruci haeremus, ſanguinem ſugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A faith Actuated in the Ordinance is a <hi>bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucking faith, Prov.</hi> 30. 15. <hi>The horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech hath two daughters which cry, Give, give.</hi> Such an eager, and holy greedineſſe hath faith in ſucking in Chriſts bloud. It cannot be ſatisfied, but ſtill cries, Give, give. Lord <hi>give</hi> me evermore of this bloud, <hi>give</hi> me
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:260:304"/> of this bloud to ſprinkle my unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoule, <hi>Give</hi> me of this bloud to ſtaunch the bloudy iſſues of mine heart, <hi>Give</hi> me of this bloud to heale my leproſe ſpirit, <hi>Give</hi> me of this bloud to helpe ſubdue and mortifie my luſts, <hi>Give</hi> me of this bloud of Chriſt crucified, to crucifie old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and all my rebllious luſts. Thus when a man ſuckes in earneſtly the bloud of Chriſt, whom he ſees cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſhedding his bloud in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſuckes it in for his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpeciall neceſſities, then is faith Actuated in the uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>And thus alſo may and muſt a man Actuate his faith for his comfort. In this baſon of the Sacrament I ſee Chriſts bloud. Chriſts bloud is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling bloud, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21. It is <hi>juſtifying bloud, Rom.</hi> 5. 9. We are juſtifyed by faith. How by faith? <hi>By faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. It is a <hi>pacifying bloud, Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14. A <hi>pardoning bloud, Mat.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

Phyſitions before they give phyſicke prepare the body for it, and give it when the body is in a convenient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for it, but that is not all. They have alſo a ſpeciall care to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and dyet a man after he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his phyſicke. For though a mans body may be well prepared before taking phyſicke, and be well diſpoſed in taking it, yet if a man be not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carefull of taking cold, be not carefull what, and when he eates, his phyſicke will not kindly worke, nor
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:260:311"/> doe him any good. Careleſneſſe in dyet, in taking cold afterwards may <note place="margin">Qui pharmacum ſumunt, ſolent eo die ab omnibus abſtinere quibus pharmaci vis, &amp; operatio, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poteſt. Gualth. in 1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> dead, and kill the force of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, ſo as it may not onely doe a man no good, but much hurt, though the phyſicke were very good and proper for his body, and diſeaſe. A great care therefore ought to be had of a due, and a right ordering our ſelves after the Sacrament. And this care thus to order our ſelves ſtands in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In a mans examining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after he is come from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate, and ſo let him drinke. So alſo, let a man eate, and drinke, and ſo let him examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. A man is ſeriouſly, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, after he hath beene at the <hi>Lords</hi> Table, to conſider between God, and his owne ſoule what entertainment, and welcome GOD hath given him, whether God hath dealt with him at this Supper, as <hi>Mary</hi> delt with CHRIST at that Supper, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:260:312"/> 2, 3. whether the LORD hath powred any precious oyntment upon him or not, what comfort, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith, and grace he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, what quickning, what refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what friendſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with CHRIST, what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hee hath found to flow out of Chriſt into his owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now upon ſuch examination a man ſhall finde that it hath been well with him at the Sacrament, or it hath not, he hath had a good day of it, or no good day. And accordingly as he findes, ſo he is to proceed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then if a man have found no joy, comfort, enlargement, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, nor anſwer from CHRIST, but upon examination findes that he hath beene unfruitfull, and that his heart was full of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hardeneſſe, and dulneſſe of ſpirit; then two things are to bee done:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Suſpect thy ſelfe that ſome miſcarriage hath beene in thee, either
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:260:312"/> in thy preparation to, or in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty. Labour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to finde out where the faile was, and what it was that hindred the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Sacrament, that cauſed God to keep his hand cloſe, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to deny to anoynt thee with freſh oyle. And having found out what hindred, and deaded the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, judge thy ſelfe for that, and be ſeriouſly humbled for it. And this being thus done, ſo that after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving we can but be ſenſible of our owne ſenſeleſneſſe of heart in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty, and can mourne for it, and complaine to God of it, and of our ſelves, we neede not be overmuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied, and caſt downe, becauſe this is one fruit of the life of Chriſt which was undoubtedly received in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Though thou haſt not that thou wouldeſt have had, yet thou haſt that which was worth the going for. Conſtrue this very thing as a fruite of going to the Sacrament, and be thankefull for that.</p>
               <pb n="592" facs="tcp:260:313"/>
               <p> Secondly, Endeavour by after paines in prayer, and humiliation to quicken, and awaken the efficacy of the Sacrament, for this wee muſt know as a point of great uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>that Sacraments doe not alwaies worke for the preſent, but the efficacy may come afterwards.</hi> It is in this caſe as in that, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. 6, 9. <hi>Samuel</hi> anoynted <hi>Saul</hi> and ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it was ſo that when had turned his back to goe from Samuel, God gave him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart.</hi> The Spirit of God came not upon him in the Anoynting, but afterwards, when hee was departed from <hi>Samuel.</hi> The Actions of God are of eternall efficacy, though he put forth that efficacy in ſuch times, and ſeaſons as he ſees good. Though the Sacrament worke not for the preſent in the adminiſtration, yet if wee bee after touched with a ſenſe of our unworthineſſe, and thereupon awaken our ſelves to quicken the Ordinance to our ſelves, the Sacrament, ſhall be
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:260:313"/> ready afterwards to empty it ſelfe with bleſſings upon our ſoules, and ſhall prove effectuall, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto thee. The firſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper the Diſciples received, it is not like they found the efficacy of it for the preſent, for they then knew, nor underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of CHRISTS death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it ſinke into their heads that he ſhould dye, but yet afterwards when they came more cleerely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the myſteries of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the whole doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no queſtion but they reaped the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that Ordinance, which then they fully underſtood not. Phyſicke doth not alwayes worke when it is taken, but many times a good while, ſome dayes after. It is with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as it is with the word. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man heares the word; and minds it, but for the preſent it hath no work at all. It is poſſible that ſeven yeares, twenty yeares after it may worke, a Sermon preached ſeven yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:260:314"/> may prove the meanes of a mans converſion ſeaven yeares after, wee have an example in that kinde, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 41, 42. <hi>And many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, Iohn did no miracle, but all things that ſpake of this man were true, and many beleeved on him there. Iohn</hi> had preacht of Chriſt before, they did not there upon beleeve in Chriſt when hee preacht. <hi>Iohn</hi> was dead, and gone, but now when <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes amongſt them, they upon <hi>Iohns</hi> former Sermons preacht a great while before, doe now beleeve. <hi>Iohn</hi> was dead, but his word was not dead, that now workes when he lyes in his grave. Thus alſo may it be with the Sacrament, it doth not alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently worke, it may, and doth work ſome longer time afterwards, when a Communicant humbled for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe in the duely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by after-diligence and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to quicken and put life into it. And if ſuch a courſe may quicken a Sacrament ſome time after, then why
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:260:314"/> not much more on the ſame day? What hinders but it may bee in the caſe of the Sacrament of the Supper, as in the Sacrament of Baptiſme? The efficacy, and force of Baptiſme doth not preſently appeare, no not preſently upon the yeeres of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Many an one lives vitiouſly, in ſinfull courſe, a ſwearer, adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet afterwards if God give once a man the heart to bee toucht with the ſenſe of his owne unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and hee beginnes to beſtirre himſelfe to ſecke GOD by faith, and Repentance, the <hi>Lord</hi> quickens a mans Baptiſme, and makes it as powerfull, and efficacious as if that very day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. So in this caſe, poſſibly a man that hath beene at the <hi>Lords</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and hath more then once beene an unworthy receiver, but yet if a man ſhall come once to bee humbled of that unworthineſſe, <hi>God</hi> will make ſacraments ſo oft unprofitably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to become efficacious unto him. For though hee were unprepared to
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:260:315"/> receive, yet <hi>God</hi> was not unprepared to diſpenſe the benefit of them. Therefore if wee have miſcarried in our preparations, and diſpoſitions ſo as we have found no benefit, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet here is a remedy and an help, take this courſe by after-diligence, and after-Humiliation to fetch life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Ordinance in which thou wert dead, and which was dead unto thee in the Adminiſtration. It is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and foule fault amongſt many, that ſo ſoone as the Sacrament is done, and the duty ended in publike, they never once looke after it more. They leave the Sacramentall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and devotion in the Church, there they ſhake hands with it, and bring not a whit of it home with them. When the Sacrament is done, all is done with them, and as they come to it, ſo they goe from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any examination at all. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once more thought upon. And thereupon no Humiliation for dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hardneſſe, and indiſpoſition in
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:260:315"/> the duty, and no care to make up that by after diligence, wherein they were wanting in the preſent perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> If upon this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we finde that we were refreſhed, had our hearts enlarged, had vertue from, and communion with Chriſt, and that GOD was very good to us, then doe theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Firſt,</hi> Bleſſe <hi>God</hi> with all thy ſoule for his mercy ſhewed unto thee, acknowledge with all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe <hi>Gods</hi> gracious dealing with thee in the communication, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of himſelfe to thee in his Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be carefull, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keepe up, and maintaine that holy, and gracious frame of heart in thee which thou acquireſt in, and bringeſt from the Sacrament with thee. A man when he findes enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a gracious diſpoſition of ſpirit in the Ordinance, ſhould be of <hi>Peters</hi> mind, when in the Mount with
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:260:316"/> our Saviour in his transfiguration, <hi>Master, It is good being here.</hi> It is good to be here as long as may bee, when therefore in the Sacrament wee have gotten holy affections by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees wound up to ſome ſpirituall height, have gotten them up to more than an ordinary, and common pitch, our care ſhould be to keep, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſo long as we can, what we have gotten at the Sacrament, to keepe the ſweete meates wee bring from this banquet. It is true indeed that wee cannot hold them up in that height, and pitch, to which we have wrought our hearts in holy duties, and in the heate of holy exerciſes, but yet wee ſhould endeavour it what we can, and ſo long as is poſſible by after private duties of prayer, meditation, good conference, and the like. That as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayes for the people in that caſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 18. when he ſaw them in a floate of good affections, their hearts ſweetely, and graciouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>keepe this for</hi>
                  <pb n="599" facs="tcp:260:316"/> 
                  <hi>ever in the Imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare or ſtabliſh their heart unto thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord</hi> thou ſeeſt what a good frame of heart is in them at this preſent, oh that thou wouldeſt keepe, and maintaine this frame of heart in them ever. So when we finde a good frame of heart wrought in us at the Sacrament, wee ſhould pray, and endeavour that this frame of heart might bee ſtill upheld, and continued in us. See an excellent example of this after a Sacrament, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 21, 22. They finde their hearts comfortably, and ſweetly enlarged in the uſe of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance, and loath they are to let this frame of heart ſinke in them, faine would they keepe it up ſtill, and therefore ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 23. what they doe: <hi>And the whole aſſembly tooke counſell to keep other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, and they kept other ſeaven dayes with gladneſſe.</hi> This was done to keep up ſtill this gladneſſe of heart which they had in keeping the firſt
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:260:317"/> ſeven daies. And this by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, ſerves to teach us what a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care we ſhould have after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, to looke wiſely to our ſelves, to keepe alive as long as may be, that holy fire that was kindled in our hearts in the uſe of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>It is a groſſe miſcarriage, &amp; a ſhrewd faile in men, who after good and faire enlargements at the Sacrament, have no care to keepe their hearts in good frame by prayer, meditation, or good conference, but as ſoone as they come from the Sacrament, doe fall to worldly and earthly conference, or vaine and idle diſcourſe, and ſo all on a ſudden quench, daſh, and dampe all, undoe all they have been ſo long a doing in their preparations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. Such abrupt chopping off, and jumping off from holy duties, is a dangerous quenching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Such a quenching of the Spirit, as tends much to the hardening of the heart. Yron red hot put into water,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:260:317"/> and ſuddenly quencht, it makes it the harder. It is a very dangerous thing to the body, when it is hot, and in a ſweat, ſuddenly to cole it; by caſting off a mans clothes, or leaping into the cold water: Such a thing is as much as a mans life is worth. Such ſudden coolings, and dampings of ſpirituall heats, got in holy duties, cannot be without much danger to the ſoule. What a poore thing is it, that when at the Sacrament a man hath gotten an excellent fire kindled, and flaming in his heart, that an houre or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee ſhould not have ſo much as a coale, or a ſparke of that fire remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And ſo much for the firſt thing to be done after Receiving, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>examining</hi> of our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſecond thing</hi> to be done followes: And that is; A ſpeciall, and a wondrous great care to keepe touch with GOD, to expreſſe the power, and efficacy of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in making our good, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our vowes and covenants we have
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:260:318"/> made at the Sacrament, our owne hearts are very falſe, fickle, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, there is therefore the more neede to looke narrowly to them. They never long more to breake looſe, then when they are freſh bound with new cords. The divell alſo is exceeding malicious: Hee is never more buſie, more violent to tempt, and bring men to ſin, then when they come new from the Sacrament. Hee knowes that is the way to make their ſinnes out of meaſure ſinfull. Hee is exceeding deſirous to goe in, and goe downe after a Sacramentall ſop. No ſooner was CHRIST Baptized, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. but <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. preſently after the Sacrament received, hee ſets fiercely, and with all his skill, and ſtrength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his tentations. Looke how <hi>Senacherib</hi> did with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo doth Satan with us: When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had reformed the Church, ſetled the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD, and had put all in good order, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. then Chapt. 32. 1. <hi>After theſe things, and the eſtabliſhment</hi>
                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:260:318"/> 
                  <hi>thereof, Senacherib came with his army into the land.</hi> So when a man hath beene at the Sacrament, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his Covenants with GOD, and ſtabliſhed his reſolutions of better obedience; <hi>After thoſe things,</hi> the Divell will come with all his forces, and ſeeke to make a man breake his vowes, and neglect his Covenants. Therefore proportionable, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the looſeneſſe of our hearts, and to the malice of Satan, ſhould our care be to keepe our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and our vowes, and to expreſſe, and manifeſt the power, and vertue of Gods Ordinance in the holineſſe, and obedience of our lives. Now ſhould our care be to ſhew what benefit wee have received by the Sacrament, in walking cloſely with GOD in the forſaking all former ſinnes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all duties of obedience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly neglected. <hi>Elias,</hi> after he was fed by GOD, went in the ſtrength of that food <hi>forty daies, and fortie nights,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 8. So ſhould we
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:260:319"/> walke in the ſtrength of our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall foode many daies and nights, and ſhew that indeed we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtrength by, and from it by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our covenants with GOD of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and obedience. See how Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſpeakes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 5, 6. Shee kills her beaſts, ſhe mingles her wine, ſhee furniſhes her Table, ſhee invites her gueſts; <hi>Come,</hi> ſaies ſhe, <hi>eate of my bread, and drinke of the drinke which I have mingled.</hi> But marke what it is that ſhee requires of her gueſts after ſhe hath fed them, and feaſted them at her Table, <hi>Forſake the fooliſh and live, and goe in the way of underſtanding.</hi> Now, that I have fed and feaſted you at my Table, live now no more as yee were wont to doe; now chooſe new company, and new courſes, now become new men, and goe, and walke in new waies. It is the very thing that GOD lookes for at our hands after we have been at the Sacrament. So ſhould it be with a man after his communion with GOD in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:260:319"/> as it was with <hi>Iacob</hi> after his communion with GOD in <hi>Bethel: Geneſ.</hi> 29. 1. <hi>Then Iacob lift up his feet, and came into the land of the people of the Eaſt.</hi> Hee lift up his feet, he went with ſtrength, with ſpirit, with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and <hi>Then</hi> he went, that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had had that ſweet fellowſhip with GOD in <hi>Bethel,</hi> hee was ſo cheered, and refreſhed with that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall baite, that in the ſtrength, and force of that, he went on livelily, and cheerily in his journey. So when we have had fellowſhip with GOD in the Sacrament, in the ſtrength of that heavenly baite at the Sacrament, wee ſhould <hi>lift up our feete,</hi> and goe on cheerily, livelily, luſtily in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards Heaven. After Chriſt had beene at <hi>Iordan</hi> at the Sacrament, he goes forth furniſhed with ſtrength from Gods Ordinance to encounter the Divell; <hi>Then Ieſus returned from Iordan full of the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>to be tempted of the Divell: Mat.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 1. Hee went from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:260:320"/> 
                  <hi>full of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, and full of power againſt the filthy ghoſt. So ſhould wee riſe from the Sacrament full of the Holy Ghoſt, <note place="margin">Tanquam Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes igitur ignem ſpirantes ab il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la menſa receda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus facti diabolo terribiles, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put noſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mente revolve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem quam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis exhibuit, <hi>Chry.</hi> ad pop.

Therefore that we may ſhew that wee have made good the end of the Sacrament, wee muſt mortifie luſts, and performe duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with more power than ever. That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, &amp;c.</hi> It muſt ſpecially be remembred after the Sacrament; Let him that ſwore, ſweare no more; that uſed to lye, lye
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:260:320"/> no more; to be drunke, be drunke no more; to be uncleane, be uncleane no more, &amp;c. This we come for to the Sacrament, and this vow wee at the Sacrament. It is the note of a man that ſhall goe to Heaven: <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 15. <hi>That he keeps his oaths and his promiſes, though to his owne hurt.</hi> How much more then ſhould a man be carefull of his oathes and promiſes which hee makes to GOD in the Sacrament, and that for his owne good? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the Sacrament thus thinke, and reaſon the caſe with thy ſelfe: I have beene at the Sacrament, I have there vowed, and taken the Sacrament upon it, that I will forſake my ſinnes, I have beene a ſwearer, oathes have beene frequently, and familiarly in my mouth, I have beene guilty of drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, covetouſneſſe; well now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my vow at the Sacrament, I will watch over my tongue that I ſweare no more, I will get this <hi>bloud out of my mouth,</hi> and this <hi>abomination</hi>

And ſo ſhe quenched the fiery darts of the Divell with the waters of her baptizme. So do when Satan tempts thee after the receiving of the Supper: Avoide Satan, I have received the Sacrament, and therein made a covenant to the contrary.</p>
               <p>It is a great fault in men that they are no more watchfull over their hearts, and wayes after the receiving of the Sacrament, and no more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to expreſſe the power of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in their lives. It was a great
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:260:322"/> fault in the Diſciples, that there was at all a contention amongſt them for greatneſſe, and ſuperiority, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 24. But their fault was ſo much the greater by the circumſtance of time wherein the quarrell ſprang, for it was preſently after they had received both the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, and the Lords Supper, as appeares by the verſes before going. Was that a time to be contending, to be ſtriving, when they were newly riſen from the Sacrament? contending, and ſtriving with God in prayer, for a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Ordinance freſhly received, had beene farre more ſeemely, and ſeaſonable, wofull is the carriage of many, and much to be lamented. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to the Sacrament, and there make their vowes of Renouncing their ſins, and becomming new men, and yet when once the action is over, and paſt, how ſoone are their vowes forgotten? how quickly returne they to their old courſes againe? It may be, the ſame weeke returne unto the
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:260:322"/> ſame ſinnes, receive the Sacrament on the Lords day, and drink drunk again before the next Lords day, nay it may be, be drunke the next morrow, nay it were to be wiſhed, that it were not to true a complaint, that they be drunke the ſelfe ſame day. So for other ſins, men have not the care, nor conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to forbeare them the ſame day, but ſweare the ſame day they receive, and have their oathes in their mouths before the bread, and wine are well out of their mouthes: Iuſt as the ſtrumpet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 14, 18. <hi>I have peace offerings with me; this day I have paid my vowes, come let us take our fill of love,</hi> ſo ſhe ſtiles her filthy luſt, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till morning, let us ſolace our ſelves with loves.</hi> The <hi>ſelfe ſame day</hi> that ſhe had beene at the ſacrifice, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the <hi>ſelfe ſame day</hi> ſhee playes the Whore, and comes from the Altar, into the adulterers bed. How hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous had her adultery beene at any time, but when ſhe had beene at <hi>Gods</hi> Altar, to play the ſtrumpet, and the
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:260:323"/> filth in <hi>that very day,</hi> how heynous was her tranſgreſſion? Muſt ſhe needs ſacrifice her ſelfe to the Divell in her luſts in the <hi>ſame day</hi> ſhe had beene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to <hi>God?</hi> It is an heynous thing that hath beene objected juſtly againſt ſome impure Popiſh votaries, that they have riſen from Harlots ſides, to conſecrate the Sacrament. And is it not as heynous to riſe from the Sacrament to whoredome, as to riſe from whoredome to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Is it not as heynous a thing to riſe from the Sacrament to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to riſe from drunkenneſſe to the Sacrament? How happy were it that that which was laid to Iſraels charge, might not be charged upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too too many Communicants, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>The people ſate downe to eate, and drinke and roſe up to play.</hi> How many ſit downe to eate, and drinke the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall elements, and that done, riſe up to play? To what play? To play the beaſts, to play the ſwine, to play the wantons, to play the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:260:323"/> and ſo make themſelves by ſuch receiving, twofold more the children of the Divell then they were before. That was exceeding heynous, and horrible, that the Lord complaines of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 39. <hi>for when they had ſlaine their children to their Idols, then they came</hi> the ſame day <hi>into my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to prophane it.</hi> What villany was this? Play the Idolaters, the mercileſſe murderers of their owne Children, and then come <hi>the ſame day</hi> into the Lords Sanctuary? what had they to doe to come into Gods <hi>Sanctuary</hi> upon any day, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon <hi>the ſame day?</hi> And had it not beene every whit as hainous to have come to Gods <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> to the Lords Table, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 12. and <hi>the ſame day</hi> to have committed Idolatry, murther, and ſo alſo to fall to Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Drunkenneſſe, Blaſphemy, and oathes? Is not this in an high degree to pollute Gods name, and his Table, and to make the fruit thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 12. What is

               <p>But yet ſome againe there are, that have ſo much reverence to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo much reſpect to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that upon that day they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they will carry themſelves fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and demurely. If they be tempted by their companions to any irregular carriage, they can anſwer, Oh fie, by no meanes, I have beene to day at the Sacrament, I may not ſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my ſelfe. And it is a good anſwer; But yet that day once over, the next day, or a few daies after, let out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and take their former ſinfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. Now here let men a little conſider themſelves. Doth the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall efficacie laſt, and doth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall covenant binde but for a day? If, becauſe thou haſt beene at the Sacrament to day, it be a good argument that thou muſt not ſin, and
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:260:325"/> breake out to day; why is it not as good an argument for the next day, for the next weeke, for the next month, the next yeer? Is the efficacy, the bond of the Sacrament ſtinted to a day? Nay, if thou returne to thy ſins ſeven yeeres, twenty yeeres after thou haſt received; if in ſo long a time thou ſhouldeſt not, or couldeſt not receive againe, yet ſtill the bond is as ſtrong upon thy conſcience, as if thou hadſt received the Sacrament but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day. There is one and the ſame reaſon in both Sacraments. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme is but one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and that in our infancie, and yet I know our <hi>Baptiſmall vow,</hi> and covenant, binds to the day of our death, though we ſhould live an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres, yea, though wee ſhould fulfill <hi>Methuſela's</hi> daies. The ſame covenant and vow wee make in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, we renew at the Supper, and the bond in this, as binding and as laſting as in the other Sacrament. That is true, or ſhould at leaſt be true
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:260:325"/> of both the Sacraments, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of the Rocke, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>They dranke of that ſpirituall Rocke that followed them, or went with them.</hi> They dranke of the materiall Rocke, which is called <hi>a ſpirituall Rocke,</hi> becauſe it was a type of Chriſt. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not onely drinke of the Rocke when they were at it, but after they were removed and gone from it, they ſtill dranke of it. But how could that be? yes, the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>The Rocke followed them.</hi> That is, the water that iſſued out of the Rocke <hi>followed</hi> them as they journyed, and <hi>ſtreamed</hi> after them in their removes. So the Rocke <hi>followed</hi> them <hi>virtually,</hi> the vertue and benefit of the Rocke followed them, and went along with them. So is it, ſo ſhould we have a care it ſhould be, that the Sacraments ſhould not onely be efficacious when we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at them, and in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, but their efficacy and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhould <hi>follow</hi> us, and <hi>ſtreame</hi> after us all the while wee are travelling in
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:260:326"/> the wilderneſſe of this world, till we come into Heaven.</p>
               <p>When we come to the Sacrament, and doe not ſhew the efficacy and power of it, doe not keepe our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and walke the more religiouſly and fruitfully after it, there followes upon it theſe two evills:</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Firſt,</hi> God accounts ſuch recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſervice done to him. The Sacrament received without follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and anſwerable obedience, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and accounts as no ſervice at all to him. Looke how God conteſts with his people, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 5. 6, 7. <hi>Did yee at all faſt unto me, even to me? And when yee did eate, and when yee did drinke, did yee not eate &amp;c? Should yee not heare the words, &amp;c?</hi> As if hee had ſaid; yee have kept many faſts for many yeeres, but yee did no ſervice to me in all your faſts; for your faſting was no more ſervice to me, then when yee did eat and drink for your ſelves, and for your owne pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. But how ſo? Becauſe with your
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:260:326"/> faſting, yee joyned not your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to me and my words, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no obedience in your lives; and therefore you faſted not unto me. <hi>Did yee at all faſt to me, to me?</hi> So likewiſe will God conteſt with ſuch commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, as doe not expreſſe the power of the Sacrament, and keepe not their ſacramentall covenants in following obedience. When yee received the Sacrament in the firſt, ſecond, third, and every moneth in the yeere, did ye at all performe any ſervice unto mee, unto me? And when yee did eat, and when yee did drinke, did yee not eat for your ſelves, and drinke for your ſelves? <hi>Should yee not heare the words</hi> which the Lord cries by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? Your eating and drinking at the Sacrament, is no more ſervice to me, then when yee eat and drinke at your owne ordinary tables for your ſelves, and your owne pleaſures, ſo long as after your receiving, and eating, and drinking at my Table, there followes no expreſſion of the power of mine
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:260:327"/> Ordinance, no conſcience of keeping your covenants, in yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my words in your lives. Now what comfort can we have in our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Sacrament, if God accept it not as a ſervice done to him? Nay, it is ſo farre from being a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice accepted of God as done to him, that he accounts it treachery againſt him. It is true here, which <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>But they like men, tranſgreſſed the Couenant,</hi> There have they dealt treacherouſly againſt me: There, that is, in the very Covenant they have plaid falſe with me; where they thought they did God great ſervice, there they abuſed him; where they thought to pleaſe God, there they provoked him to anger, there they dealt treacherouſly againſt me. It is in it ſelfe a ſervice to God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, and to make a Covenant with him. And many thinke they doe God good ſervice herein, but they are deceived, becauſe like deceitfull falſe hearted men, they
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:260:327"/> tranſgreſſed the Covenant; There, there, in the very Covenant, they deale treacherouſly againſt GOD. And ſo it is no ſervice, but a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Lord: For what can provoke more then treachery? And what is it but treachery to tranſgreſſe ſo ſolemne a Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> we horribly pollute, and take Gods Name in vaine, and make our ſelves guilty of <hi>ſpirituall perjury</hi> before God. What thinke we of perjured and forſworne perſons? What think we wil become of them? When we take an oath ſolemnely at the Lords Table to forſake our ſins, to walke in obedience in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch holy duties, and then afterwards live in thoſe ſins ſtill, and in the neglect of thoſe duties ſtill, Are we not forſworne? If we ſweare <note place="margin">Siquidem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, &amp; non ſolvens, quid niſi peiero? <hi>Bernard.</hi> de Precept. &amp; Diſp. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> to doe ſuch a thing, and doe it not, doe we not forſweare? And is it a light thing with us to be forſworne, and that by the breach of an oath, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made ſolemnely with God?
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:260:328"/> Doe but conſider, how heavily God threatens <hi>Zedekiah</hi> for breaking his oath and covenant, with the King of <hi>Babylon, Ezek.</hi> 17. 12.—21. Reade, and well obſerve the whole place. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> made an oath to <hi>Nebucad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> and brake it: And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon it? Verſ. 15. <hi>Shall hee eſcape that doth ſuch things? or ſhall he breake the Covenant, and be delivered?</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>As I live, ſurely mine oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that hee hath broken, even it will I recompenſe upon his owne head.</hi> But how? <hi>He ſhould die for it</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Verſ. 16. and it firſt coſt him the <hi>loſſe of his eyes,</hi> ſo ſoone as he had ſeene his children ſlaine before his eyes. So ſmart vengeance hath God for perjury. God hath ſworne that he will be revenged upon ſuch as are forſworne, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. And though men will, yet GOD will not bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne. Now then will the Lord be ſo heavily avenged for breach of oath, and covenant with a man, nay,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:260:328"/> with an heathen man, and an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Woe then to that man that breakes covenant with the great God of heaven and earth, who will not be mocked, who will not bee baffled withall, who will be a ſwift witneſſe, and a ſevere Iudge againſt all ſuch as groſſely take his glorious Name in vaine, and ſo foulely pollute his holy Ordinance. And thus a man doing the duties required <hi>before, in,</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Receiving of the Sacrament, comes to the Sacrament after <hi>the due order.</hi> And he that <hi>walkes after this Rule, peace ſhall be upon him, and all the Iſrael of God.</hi>
